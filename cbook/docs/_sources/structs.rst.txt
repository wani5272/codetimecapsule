Aggregate Data Structures
*************************

.. index:: struct, record types

The C ``struct``
================

C has a facility for grouping data elements together in the form of a "record", which is called a ``struct``.  A ``struct`` in C is sort of like a class (in languages with classes), except that (1) all members of the ``struct`` are public (i.e., there is no way to "hide" members), and (2) there are no methods, only data members.  Members of a ``struct`` are often referred to as ``fields``.

The following code defines a type called ``struct fraction`` that has two integer fields named ``numerator`` and ``denominator``.  Note that a semicolon is required after the final curly brace of the declaration, as well as after the declaration of each field.

.. code-block:: c

    struct fraction {
        int numerator;
        int denominator;
    };  // don't forget the semicolon!


Note that the full name of the new type is ``struct fraction``, not just ``fraction``.  Thus, if we want to create a new fraction variable, we write:

.. code-block:: c

    struct fraction f1;

C uses the period (``.``) as the operator to access individual fields in a ``struct`` (similar to the way that the period is used to access instance variables in a Java or Python object).  The following code assigns values to the two fields of our new variable, then prints out the contents of the ``struct``:

.. code-block:: c

    f1.numerator = 3;
    f1.denominator = 5;
    printf("f1 is %d/%d\n", f1.numerator, f1.denominator);

..

.. index:: 
   single: initializing structs
   double: struct; initializing


Initializing ``struct``\ s
--------------------------

A syntax similar to array initialization can be used to initialize fields of a ``struct``.  For example, to declare and initialize a new ``struct fraction``, we could use the following:

.. code-block:: c

    struct fraction f2 = { 3, 5};

which would assign 3 to the ``numerator`` field and 5 to the ``denominator`` field.  An explicit field assignment syntax can also be used:

.. code-block:: c

    struct fraction f3 = { .denominator = 5, .numerator = 3 };

Note that using the *explicit* field assignment syntax, the field assignments do not need to appear in the same order as the original declaration of the ``struct``.  



.. sidebar:: Annoyance: ``==`` does not work with ``struct``\ s

    Unfortunately, the comparison for equality operator (``==``) does *not* work with ``struct``\ s.  In fact, the code ``if (f5 == f4)`` will not even compile.  One way to address comparing structures is to write a function to compare them, which we will discuss in the :ref:`functions` chapter.  Another way is to directly compare the contents of memory occupied by two ``struct``\ s, which we will discuss in the :ref:`pointers` chapter.

.. index:: 
   single: = and structs
   double: =; struct

Copying ``struct``\ s
---------------------

Conveniently, the ``=`` (assignment) operator can be used to copy the contents of one struct into another.  The copy is done in a field-by-field manner:

.. code-block:: c

    struct fraction f4 = { 2, 7 };
    struct fraction f5 = f4;  // f5 now has identical contents as f4

There is another way to copy ``struct``\ s (using the built-in ``memcpy`` function), but since this method requires use of "pointers" we will defer discussion until the :ref:`pointers` chapter.

.. index:: typedef, type aliases

Arrays of ``struct``\ s and type aliases (``typedef``)
------------------------------------------------------

It is perfectly valid, and quite common, to have arrays of records.  For example, we might want to have a whole series of fractions stored in an array, as follows:

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:

    struct fraction numbers[100];
    numbers[0].numerator = 22;       // set the 0th struct fraction 
    numbers[0].denominator = 7;

The declaration on line 1, above, is a little bit of a mouthful, but reading from right-to-left can help: "an array of 100 elements called numbers, where each element contains a struct fraction".  To help simplify reading and writing type complex declarations, C contains a mechanism for creating *type aliases*, using the keyword ``typedef``.  The syntax goes ``typedef <original type> <type alias>``, as follows:


.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:

    typedef struct fraction fraction_t;
    fraction_t numbers2[100];

Line 1 defines a type alias for ``struct fraction`` called ``fraction_t`` (a "fraction type").  Now, ``fraction_t`` can be used where ever we might originally have used ``struct fraction``.  On line 2, an array of these fraction structures is created, which is a tiny bit easier to read than the first array declaration.  

.. index:: 
   double: struct; memory alignment
   double: struct; compiler-inserted padding
   double: struct; sizeof

Using ``sizeof`` with a ``struct`` and memory layout of a ``struct``
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The built-in ``sizeof`` function works quite happily with a ``struct``.  It returns the number of bytes occupied by the struct in memory.  As with other data types, either a variable name or a type name may be used as the argument to ``sizeof``. For example, consider the following code:

.. code-block:: c

    struct fraction f6 = { 1, 2};
    printf("Size of f6: %lu\n", sizeof(f6));
    printf("Size of struct fraction: %lu\n", sizeof(struct fraction));

On almost all machines today, the output of the above code will be::

    Size of f6: 8
    Size of struct fraction: 8

since the size of a single int is almost always 4 bytes.

No surprises there, right?  Let's look at the following program, which defines a ``struct student`` containing a name, class year, and age.

.. literalinclude:: code/structalign.c
   :language: c
   :linenos:

Compiling and running this code gives this output::

    An example student: H. Sommers, 2026, 5
    Size of a student struct: 36

Consider the size reported by the program, 36, and remember that a ``short`` is 2 bytes and ``char`` is 1 byte.  Last time I checked, :math:`32 + 2 + 1 = 35`!  What's happening?!

When the compiler allocates memory on the stack or the heap for a ``struct``, it may introduce "padding" bytes to ensure that the entire ``struct`` fits within an even multiple of machine words.  If the word size is 4 bytes, then the compiler will silently add ``sizeof(struct) % 4`` bytes as "padding" to the end of the struct [#f1]_.  So, in the ``struct student`` definition starting on line 3, above, there is one extra byte added by the compiler to make the entire structure occupy a "word-aligned" number of bytes.  A picture of how an actual ``struct student`` looks in memory is thus like the following:

.. figure:: figures/structalign.* 
   :align: center
   
   An struct that has "padding" inserted by the compiler.

The padding inserted by the compiler is not usually something one needs to pay close attention to, but in certain circumstances it *does* matter and it's good to be aware of this behavior.

.. rubric:: Exercises

1. Assume that you have a text file with a series of student names, class years, and ages listed, like the following::

       Alice Z., 2020, 17
       Bob Y., 2019, 19
       Chelsea X., 2020, 18
       Draco M., 2019, 20

   Write a program that reads the text file contents from standard input (hint below) and stores each student in a C struct in an array.  After you've loaded the students, print each of them out on a separate line, and print the average age (as a floating point number) at the end.  (To format a floating point number for output using ``printf``, you can use the ``%f`` placeholder.)

   You can assume any reasonable upper-bound for the number of characters in a name, and any reasonable upper-bound for the number of students.  That is, you should *overallocate* space required for the name and number of students, within reason.  An upper bound for student name might be 64, and an upper bound for the number of students might be 100.

   You can use the ``fgets`` call to read data from standard input (just as you've already done for keyboard input), and use "shell redirection" to cause the contents of a text file to be treated as stdin to your program.  Say that you've compiled the code to an executable called ``sreader`` and the student data is in the text file ``students.txt``, you could do the redirection trick by typing::

       $ ./sreader < students.txt

2.  Extend the above program to do the following.  After all the student records are loaded, repeatedly ask for a student first name until the special string ``DONE`` is entered.  For each valid name entered, search for the name in the array of records and print the values within the relevant records found (note that more than one student may match the query).  If no student is found matching the name, print a message to that effect.  You should allow the search (name) entered to be compared in a case-insensitive way.  For example, the string "Bob" should match the 2nd record shown above.  As another example, the string "E" should match both "Alice Z." and "Chelsea X." (both have "e"'s, but the other two names do not).  Consider using the built-in ``strcasestr`` function [#f2]_ to compare strings.  


3.  Write a program that asks for values for two fractions (numerator and denominator for each), and computes and prints the sum of the fractions.  Store the result of the sum in a new ``struct fraction`` prior to printing the sum.
