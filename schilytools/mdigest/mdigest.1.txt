NAME
       mdigest - calculate a message digest

SYNOPSIS
       mdigest -a algorithm [ options ] [ file1 ... filen ]

DESCRIPTION
       mdigest reads the files from the argument list and computes a message
       digest hash for the file content.  If the argument list is empty
       mdigest reads from standard in.


OPTIONS
       All options can be abbreviated by their first letter.

       -a algorithm
	      Specified the message digest hash algorithm to use.

       -l     Lists the available message digest hash algorithms. This list
	      may depend on the platform and the compiler that was used to
	      create the binary.

       -help  Prints a short summary of the mdigest(1) options and exists.

       -verbose
	      Verbose output. Includes the message digest hash algorithm name
	      in the output.

       -version
	      Prints the mdigest(1) version number string and exists.


ENVIRONMENT
FILES
NOTES
       If you call mdigest with no file type arguments, it will compute the
       digest for stdin.
