NAME
       hdump, od - displays (dumps) binary contents of a file

SYNOPSIS
       hdump [options] [file [starting_address[.][b|B] [count]]]

       hdump [options] [file...]

       od [options] [file [starting_address[.][b|B]]]

       od [options] [file...]

       xpg4/bin/od [options] [file [starting_address[.][b|B]]]

       xpg4/bin/od [options] [file...]


DESCRIPTION
       Hdump displays the contents of a file in 16-bit words unless otherwise
       specified (see options below). It dumps the data in hexadecimal unless
       otherwise specified (see options below).

       Hdump assumes the starting_address and the count are in decimal unless
       there is a leading 0--interpreted as octal, or a leading
       0x--interpreted as hexadecimal (as in C).  If the starting_address is
       followed by a 'b', the number is multiplied by 512, if the
       starting_address is followed by a 'B', the number is multiplied by 512.


       The output radix of the label is hexadecimal by default and may be
       modified by the radix of the starting_address.  If the starting_address
       is specified in hexadecimal, the label will be displayed in hexadecimal
       too, if the starting_address is specified in octal, the label will be
       displayed in octal.  A decimal radix of the label will be displayed if
       the starting_address is followed by a dot.

       If the starting address is odd, it is rounded down to the next even
       value.

       The default size of displayed objects is short unless otherwise
       mentioned.

       For the od(1) features see the od(1) man page.


OPTIONS
       -A radix	 Select the radix used for address labels. The folowing values
		 are supported:

		 d	Use a decimal radix for address labels.

		 o	Use an octal radix for address labels.

		 n	Do not print address labels.

		 x	Use a hexadecimal radix for address labels.

       -a	 Display content also as printable characters, set the object
		 size to bytes.

       -b	 Display content in bytes.

       -c	 Display content in quoted characters, set the object size to
		 bytes.

       -C	 Display bytes as single-byte or multi-byte characters
		 according to the current setting of the LC_CTYPE locale
		 category.  Printable multibyte characters are written in the
		 area corresponding to the first byte of the character.	 The
		 two-character sequence ** is written in the area
		 corresponding to each remaining byte in the character, as an
		 indication that the character is continued.

       -d	 Display content in decimal

       -f	 Display content longs as floats

       -F	 Display content double longs as doubles

       -j skip	 Seek or skip skip bytes before starting to dump.  The same
		 syntax as with sdd(1) is supported.

       -l	 Display content as longs instead of using the default size
		 short.

       -N count	 Stop after dumping count bytes.  The same syntax as with
		 sdd(1) is supported.

       -o	 Display content in octal instead of using the default
		 hexadecimal radix.

       -O	 Interprets long words in unsigned octal.  This is equivalent
		 to -t o4.

       -s	 Interprets words in signed decimal.  This is equivalent to -t
		 d2.

       -S	 Interprets long words in signed decimal.  This is equivalent
		 to -t d4.

       -t format

		 a	Print bytes as 7 bit named ASCII characters.

		 c	Print bytes as quoted characters.

		 d	Print signed decimal numbers.

		 f	Print floating point numbers

		 o	Print octal numbers.

		 u	Print unsigned decimal numbers.

		 x	Print hexadecimal numbers.

		 The type specification characters d, f, o, u, and x can be
		 followed by an optional size specifier.  For the types d, o,
		 u, and x, this may be one of: 1, 2, 4, 8, C, S, I, and L.
		 For the type f, this may be one of: F, D, and L.

		 A -t option may have multiple type arguments and there may be
		 multiple -t options on the command line.

       -u	 Display content as unsigned numbers.

       -v	 Show all data even if it is identical.

       -x	 Interprets words in hex.  This is equivalent to -t x2.

       -X	 Interprets long words in hex.	This is equivalent to -t x4.

       -help	 Prints a short summary of the hdump options and exists.

       -version	 Prints the hdump version number string and exists.


       Address label radix depends on starting address radix (decimal if ends
       with .) 'b' or 'B' after starting address multiplies with 512.
