STUNAR(1)		    Schily's USER COMMANDS		     STUNAR(1)

NAME
       suntar - create tape archives and add or extract files

SYNOPSIS
       suntar  command [ options ] file1 ... filen

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents an emulation of the Sun version of tar.  It
       has been implemented on top of the star program.

       For a description of the Sun tar program check the Sun tar manual page.

OPTIONS
       Star supports the Sun tar options.


EXTENDED OPTIONS
       The extended options are options taken from star.

       --help Prints a summary of the most important options for suntar(1) and
	      exits.

       --xhelp
	      Prints a summary of the less important options for suntar(1) and
	      exits.

       --version
	      Prints the suntar version number string and exists.

       --debug
	      print additional debug messages

       xdebug=#

       xd=#   set extended debug level

       artype=headertype
	      Generate a tape archive in headertype format.  For more
	      information, see star(1).

       -/     don't strip leading '/'s from file names

       --..   don't skip filenames that contain '..' in non-interactive
	      extract

       --7z   run the input or output through a p7zip pipe - see option -z
	      below.

	      Note that the p7zip program currently does not operate on a pipe
	      but on a /tmp file copy and thus limits the maximum archive
	      size.

       --secure-links
	      don't extract links that start with '/' or contain '..'

       --no-secure-links
	      extract links that start with '/' or contain '..'

       --acl  handle access control lists

       --xfflags
	      handle extended file flags

       bs=#   set (output) block size to #

       fs=#   set fifo size to #

       --no-fsync
	      do not call fsync() for each extracted file (may be dangerous).

       --do-fsync
	      call fsync() for each extracted file.

       --time
	       print timing info

       --no-statistics
	      do not print statistics

       --do-statistics
	      rint statistics

       --fifostats
	      print fifo statistics

       --no-fifo
	      don't use a fifo to optimize data flow from/to tape

       --numeric
	      don't use user/group name from tape

       --lzo  pipe input/output through lzop, does not work on tapes

       --lzip pipe input/output through lzip, does not work on tapes

       -z     pipe input/output through gzip, does not work on tapes

       --bz   pipe input/output through bzip2, does not work on tapes

       --zstd pipe input/output through zstd, does not work on tapes

       The options above are not defined by Sun tar.

       For a complete documentation of the star based options check star(1).

DIAGNOSTICS
NOTES
       This suntar implementation is based on the star implementation and does
       not implement all features of the original Sun tar program.

       Suntar -x is equivalent to star -xU -force-remove -remove-first
       -keep-nonempty-dirs
