NAME
       fifo - a fifo buffer that reads from stdin and writes to stdout

SYNOPSIS
       fifo [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       fifo creates a shared memory area, then forks into two processes.  fifo
       then reads from stdin and puts the data into the shared memory area.
       The other process takes data from the shared memory area and writes it
       to stdout.

OPTIONS
       bs=#   Set both input and output block size to #.  You may use the same
	      method as in dd(1) and sdd(1).  The number representing the size
	      is taken in bytes unless otherwise specified.  If a number is
	      followed directly by the letter `.', `w', `b', `k', `m', `g',
	      `t', or `p', the size is multiplied by 1, 2, 512, 1024,
	      1024*1024, 1024*1024*1024, 1024*1024*1024*1024 or
	      1024*1024*1024*1024*1024.	 If the size consists of numbers
	      separated by `x' or `*', multiplication of the two numbers is
	      performed.  Thus bs=7x8k will specify a blocksize of 56 kBytes.
	      Blocksize must be a multiple of 512 bytes.

       fs=#   Set fifo size to #.  See bs= for the possible syntax.

	      The default size of the fifo is 1 Mbyte on Sun mc68000 systems,
	      4 Mbytes on non mmap() aware Linux systems and 8 Mbytes on all
	      other systems.

       ibs=#  Set input buffer size to #.  See bs= for the possible syntax.

	      If unspecified and input is a pipeline, PIPE_BUF is used.

       obs=#  Set output buffer size to #.  See bs= for the possible syntax.

	      If unspecified and output is a pipeline, PIPE_BUF is used.

       -no-statistics
	      Do not print fifo statistics at the end.

       -debug Print additional debug messages.

       -help  Prints a short summary of the fifo options and exists.

       -version
	      Prints the fifo version number string and exists.

       The fifo program was first written by J. Schilling in 1989 as a
       separate test program for buffering for star.  It was later included
       into the star program.  This program is a new attempt from 2019 to have
       a separate fifo program again.
