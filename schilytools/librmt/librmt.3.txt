NAME
       librmt - remote magtape protocol client interface library

SYNOPSIS
       cc [ flag ... ] file ...	 -lrmt -lsocket -lnsl [ library ... ]

       #include <schily/librmt.h>

DESCRIPTION
       Functions in this library provide an interface to a remote tape server
       program.

       This implementation takes care of RMT protocol VERSION 1 that is needed
       in case that rmt client and rmt server do not run on the same OS and
       use a CPU with the same bit width and byte order.

       In addition, this implementation supports a GNU extension that allows
       to use open(2) flags beyond O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR.


ENVIRONMENT
       RSH    If the RSH environment is present, the remote connection will
	      not be created via rcmd(3) but by calling the program pointed to
	      by RSH.  Use e.g.	 RSH=/usr/bin/ssh to create a secure shell
	      connection.

	      If the environment RSH is empty, then the default rcmd(3) is
	      used even in case rmtrsh(3) has been called.

       RMT    If the RMT environment is present, the remote tape server will
	      not be the program /etc/rmt but the program pointed to by RMT.

	      If the environment RMT is empty, then the default /etc/rmt is
	      used even in case rmtrmt(3) has been called.

	      Note that the remote tape server program name will be ignored if
	      you log in using an account that has been created with a remote
	      tape server program as login shell.
