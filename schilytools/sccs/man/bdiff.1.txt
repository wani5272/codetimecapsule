NAME
       bdiff - big diff

SYNOPSIS
       bdiff filename1 filename2 [n] [-s]


DESCRIPTION
       bdiff is used in a manner analogous to diff to find which lines in
       filename1 and filename2 must be changed to bring the files into
       agreement.  Its purpose is to allow processing of files too large for
       diff.  If filename1 (filename2) is -, the standard input is read.



       bdiff ignores lines common to the beginning of both files, splits the
       remainder of each file into n-line segments, and invokes diff on
       corresponding segments.	If both optional arguments are specified, they
       must appear in the order indicated above.



       The output of bdiff is exactly that of diff, with line numbers adjusted
       to account for the segmenting of the files (that is, to make it look as
       if the files had been processed whole). Note:  Because of the
       segmenting of the files, bdiff does not necessarily find a smallest
       sufficient set of file differences.



OPTIONS
       n      The number of line segments. The value of n is 3500 by default.
	      If the optional third argument is given and it is numeric, it is
	      used as the value for n.	This is useful in those cases in which
	      3500-line segments are too large for diff, causing it to fail.


       -s     Specifies that no diagnostics are to be printed by bdiff (silent
	      option). Note:  However, this does not suppress possible
	      diagnostic messages from diff, which bdiff calls.


USAGE
       See largefile(5) for the description of the behavior of bdiff when
       encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte (2^31 bytes).

NOTES
       This version of bdiff(1) supports lines of arbitrary length and is able
       to deal with binary content (null bytes) in the files. It thus calls
       diff(1) with the -a option.  The well known main caller of bdiff(1),
       which is sccs-delta(1), checks for binary content before calling
       bdiff(1).  Previous versions of bdiff(1) did not check for binary
       content and silently discarded null bytes.


AUTHORS
       The bdiff(1) program was initially written at Bell Labs in the 1970s as
       part of SCCS.  The SVr4 release was written by various authors at AT&T
       in 1989.	 The bdiff(1) programm was later maintained by various people
       at AT&T and Sun Microsystems.  Since 2006, it is maintained by Joerg
       Schilling.
