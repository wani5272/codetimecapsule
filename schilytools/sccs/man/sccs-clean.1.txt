NAME
       sccs-clean - Remove everything from a directory that can be retrieved
       from SCCS history

SYNOPSIS
       sccs clean [options] [subdirectory]

DESCRIPTION
       The clean subcommand removes everything from the current directory that
       can be recreated from SCCS history files.  It will not remove any files
       being edited.  If the -b flag is given, branches are ignored in the
       determination of whether they are being edited; this is dangerous if
       you are keeping the branches in the same directory.

       If the subdirectory argument is omitted, ``.'' is assumed.


OPTIONS
       -b     Do not check branches to see if they are being edited.  `clean
	      -b' is dangerous when branch versions are kept in the same
	      directory.


EXAMPLES
       To create a new SCCS repository in the current directory call:

	      sccs clean .

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables
       that affect the execution of sccs-clean(1): LANG, LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE,
       LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.


       SCCS_NO_HELP
	      If set, sccs clean will not automatically call help(1) with the
	      SCCS error code in order to print a more helpful error message.
	      Scripts that depend on the exact error messages of SCCS commands
	      should set the environment variable SCCS_NO_HELP and set
	      LC_ALL=C.
