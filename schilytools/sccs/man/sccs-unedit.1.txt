NAME
       sccs-unedit - "Undo" the last edit or `get -e', return to previous
       condition

SYNOPSIS
       sccs unedit [options] [file1 .. filen]

DESCRIPTION
       The sccs unedit subcommand "undo"s the last edit or `get -e', and
       return the working copy to its previous condition.  unedit backs out
       all pending changes made since the file was checked out.	 It should be
       used with extreme caution, since any changes you made since the get
       will be irretrievably lost.


OPTIONS
       -o     Retrieves the unedited file under the original time of the
	      requested version.

	      Use this option with care, as it may be in conflict with make(1)
	      rules. Using `unedit -o' thus may cause make to perform an
	      automatic retrieval of the latest version as the s.file is newer
	      than the gotten file, or cause make to skip the compilation as
	      the compilation result is already newer than the gotten file.

	      This option is a SCHILY extension that does not exist in
	      historic sccs implementations.



EXAMPLES
       To unedit the file xec.c in the current directory call:

	      sccs unedit xec.c

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables
       that affect the execution of sccs-unedit(1): LANG, LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE,
       LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.


       SCCS_NO_HELP
	      If set, sccs unedit will not automatically call help(1) with the
	      SCCS error code in order to print a more helpful error message.
	      Scripts that depend on the exact error messages of SCCS commands
	      should set the environment variable SCCS_NO_HELP and set
	      LC_ALL=C.
