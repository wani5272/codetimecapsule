NAME
       sccs-prt, prt - display delta table information from an SCCS file

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/ccs/bin/prt [-abdefistu] [-cdate-time] [-rdate-time]
	   [-ysid] [-Xextended-options] [-Nbulk-spec] s.filename...


DESCRIPTION
       prt prints selected portions of an SCCS file.  By default, it prints
       the delta table (version log).

       The output is directly based on text data from the s.files without
       conversion.


       If a directory name is used in place of the s.filename argument, the
       prt command applies to all s.files in that directory. Unreadable
       s.files produce an error; processing continues with the next file (if
       any). The use of `-' as the s.filename argument indicates that the
       names of files are to be read from the standard input, one s.file per
       line.


OPTIONS
       If any option other than -y, -c, or -r is supplied, the name of each
       file being processed (preceded by one NEWLINE and followed by two
       NEWLINE characters) appears above its contents.


       If none of the -u, -f, -t, or -b options are used, -d is assumed.  -s,
       -i are mutually exclusive, as are -c and -r.


       -a	    Display log entries for all deltas, including those marked
		    as removed.


       -b	    Print the body of the s.file.


       -d	    Print delta table entries.	This is the default.


       -e	    Everything.	 This option implies -d, -i, -u, -f, and -t.


       -f	    Print the flags of each named s.file.


       -i	    Print the serial numbers of included, excluded, and
		    ignored deltas.


       -s	    Print only the first line of the delta table entries; that
		    is, only up to the statistics.


       -t	    Print the descriptive text contained in the s.file.


       -u	    Print the user-names and/or numerical group IDs of users
		    allowed to make deltas.


       -cdate-time  Exclude delta table entries that are specified cutoff date
		    and time. Each entry is printed as a single line, preceded
		    by the name of the SCCS file.  This format (also produced
		    by -r, and -y) makes it easy to sort multiple delta tables
		    in chronological order. When both -y and -c, or -y and -r
		    are supplied, prt stops printing when the first of the two
		    conditions is met.


       -rdate-time  Exclude delta table entries that are newer than the
		    specified cutoff date and time.


       -ysid	    Exclude delta table entries made prior to the SID
		    specified.	If no delta in the table has the specified
		    SID, the entire table is printed.  If no SID is specified,
		    the most recent delta is printed.



       -Nbulk-spec  Processes a bulk of SCCS history files.  This option
		    allows to do an efficient mass processing of SCCS history
		    files.

		    The bulk-spec parameter is composed from an optional list
		    of flag parameters followed by an optional path specifier.

		    The following flag types are supported:

		    none

		    The following path specifier types are supported:

		    -N	      The file name parameters to the prt command are
			      not s.filename files but the names of the g-
			      files.  The s.filename names are automatically
			      derived from the g-file names by prepending s.
			      to the last path name component.	Both,
			      s.filename and the g-file are in the same
			      directory.

		    -Ns.      The file name parameters to the prt command are
			      s.filename files.	 The the g-files names are
			      automatically derived by removing s.  from the
			      beginning of last path name component of the
			      s.filename.  Both, s.filename and the g-file are
			      in the same directory.

		    -Ndir     The file name parameters to the prt command are
			      not s.filename files but the names of the g-
			      files.  The s.filename names are put into
			      directory dir, the names are automatically
			      derived from the g-file names by prepending
			      dir/s.  to the last path name component.

		    -Ndir/s.  The file name parameters to the prt command are
			      s.filename files in directory dir.  The the g-
			      files names are automatically derived by
			      removing dir/s.  from the beginning of last path
			      name component of the s.filename.

		    A typical value for dir is SCCS.

		    In order to overcome the limited number of exec(2)
		    arguments, it is recommended to use `-' as the file name
		    parameter for prt(1) and to send a list of path names to
		    stdin.

		    This option is a SCHILY extension that does not exist in
		    historic sccs implementations.


       -Xextended-options
		    Specify extended options. The argument extended-options
		    may be a comma separated list of extended option names.

		    The following extended options are supported, they may be
		    abbreviated as long ad the abbreviation is still unique.
		    Options with parameter may not be abbreviated.


		    0	   When reading filenames from stdin, triggered by a
			   file name argument `-', the filename separator is a
			   null byte instead of a newline.  This allows to use
			   long lists with arbitrary filenames.

		    help   Print a short online help for available options.

		    The -X option is a SCHILY extension that does not exist in
		    historic sccs implementations.


       -V
       -version
       --version    Prints the prt version number string and exists.

		    This option is a SCHILY extension that does not exist in
		    historic sccs implementations.

EXAMPLES
       Example 1 Examples of prt.


       The following command:


       example% /usr/ccs/bin/prt -y program.c


       produces a one-line display of the delta table entry for the most
       recent version:


       s.program.c:

       D 1.6   88/07/06 21:39:39 username 5 4	00159/00080/00636
       ...


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables
       that affect the execution of prt(1): LANG, LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE,
       LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.


       SCCS_NO_HELP
	      If set, prt(1) will not automatically call help(1) with the SCCS
	      error code in order to print a more helpful error message.
	      Scripts that depend on the exact error messages of SCCS commands
	      should set the environment variable SCCS_NO_HELP and set
	      LC_ALL=C.


EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values are returned:


       0    Successful completion.


       1    An error occurred.


FILES
       s.file	      SCCS history file, see sccsfile(4).


       dump.core      If the file dump.core exists in the current directory
		      and a fatal signal is received, a coredump is initiated
		      via abort(3).

AUTHORS
       The SCCS suite was originally written by Marc J. Rochkind at Bell Labs
       in 1972.	 Release 4.0 of SCCS, introducing new versions of the programs
       admin(1), get(1), prt(1), and delta(1) was published on February 18,
       1977; it introduced the new text based SCCS v4 history file format
       (previous SCCS releases used a binary history file format).  The SCCS
       suite was later maintained by various people at AT&T and Sun
       Microsystems.  Since 2006, the SCCS suite is maintained by Joerg
       Schilling.
