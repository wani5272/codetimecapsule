NAME
       sccs-help, help - ask for help regarding SCCS error or warning messages

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/ccs/bin/help [argument]...


DESCRIPTION
       The help utility retrieves information to further explain errors
       messages and warnings from SCCS commands. It also provides some
       information about SCCS command usage. If no arguments are given, help
       prompts for one.


       An argument may be a message number (which normally appears in
       parentheses following each SCCS error or warning message), or an SCCS
       command name.  help responds with an explanation of the message or a
       usage line for the command.


       When the argument is all non-numeric, the text is searched in the file
       cmds.  See the section FILES below for the related base directory.

       When the argument starts with alpha characters and ends in numbers, the
       alpha prefix is used as a key to locate a file.	If the key is seen in
       the helploc file, a new directory prefix is taken from that file, else
       it is used as a file name with the standard prefix to search for
       messages.  The remainder of the argument is used to search a label in
       the message file and to print the message text.

       When the argument starts with numbers, or a file related to key could
       not be found, the text is searched in the file default.


       When all else fails, try `/usr/ccs/bin/help  stuck'.

       /usr/ccs/lib/help/helploc

AUTHORS
       The SCCS suite was originally written by Marc J. Rochkind at Bell Labs
       in 1972.	 Release 4.0 of SCCS, introducing new versions of the programs
       admin(1), get(1), prt(1), and delta(1) was published on February 18,
       1977; it introduced the new text based SCCS v4 history file format
       (previous SCCS releases used a binary history file format).  The SCCS
       suite was later maintained by various people at AT&T and Sun
       Microsystems.  Since 2006, the SCCS suite is maintained by Joerg
       Schilling.
