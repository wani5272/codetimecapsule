NAME
       sccs-create, sccs-enter - create (initialize) history files

SYNOPSIS
       sccs create [options] [file1 .. filen]
       sccs enter [options] [file1 .. filen]


DESCRIPTION
       The create subcommand creates an SCCS file, taking the initial contents
       from the file of the same name.	Any flags to admin are accepted.  If
       the creation is successful, the files are renamed with a comma on the
       front.  These should be removed when you are convinced that the SCCS
       files have been created successfully.

       sccs create performs the following steps:

	    o	   Creates the history file called s.program.c in the SCCS
		   subdirectory.

	    o	   Renames the original source file to ,program.c in the
		   current directory.

	    o	   Performs an `sccs get' on program.c to retrieve a read-only
		   copy of the initial version.

       The enter subcommand is similar to the sccs create command, but it
       omits the final `sccs get'.  This can be used if an `sccs edit' is to
       be performed immediately after the history file is initialized.


OPTIONS
       Options are passed to the admin program, e.g.:

       -o     Use the original file time instead of the current time for the
	      time of the initial delta.


EXAMPLES
       To create a new SCCS repository for the file xec.c in the current
       directory call:

	      sccs create xec.c

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables
       that affect the execution of sccs-create(1): LANG, LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE,
       LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.


       SCCS_NO_HELP
	      If set, sccs create will not automatically call help(1) with the
	      SCCS error code in order to print a more helpful error message.
	      Scripts that depend on the exact error messages of SCCS commands
	      should set the environment variable SCCS_NO_HELP and set
	      LC_ALL=C.
