sccs-rcs2sccs(1)	    Schily's USER COMMANDS	      sccs-rcs2sccs(1)

NAME
       sccs-rcs2sccs, rcs2sccs - convert RCS files into SCCS files

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/ccs/bin/rcs2sccs [-rm] [-V6] [file...]


DESCRIPTION
       rcs2sccs converts RCS history files into SCCS history files.  If a list
       of files is specified, this list is converted.  If no file arguments
       are specified, all RCS files in the current directory are converted.

       This program is a SCHILY extension that does not exist in historic sccs
       implementations.


OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:

       -rm	    Remove the RCS history files on success.

       -V6	    Convert into SCCS v6 history files.

       -V
       -version
       --version    Prints the rcs2sccs version number string and exists.

       -help	    Print a short usage overview and exit.


EXAMPLES
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables
       that affect the execution of rcs2sccs(1): LANG, LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE,
       LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.


       SCCS_NO_HELP
	      If set, rcs2sccs(1) will not automatically call help(1) with the
	      SCCS error code in order to print a more helpful error message.
	      Scripts that depend on the exact error messages of SCCS commands
	      should set the environment variable SCCS_NO_HELP and set
	      LC_ALL=C.


FILES
       /tmp/rcs2sccs_*
		    temporary files

DIAGNOSTICS
       Use the SCCS help command for explanations of messages. See
       sccs-help(1).


NOTES
       While RCS records time stamps in GMT, SCCS uses local time.  When a
       SCCS v6 history file is created, rcs2sccs converts the time stamps to
       SCCS GMT time stamps with GMT offset +0000 which can co-exist with time
       stamps in local time.

       When a SCCS v4 history file is created, converting from RCS to SCCS is
       done by literally transforming the time stamps and thus keeping the GMT
       time base which may differ from local time.  If you like to convert the
       time stamps in the resulting SCCS files to a local timebase, call:

	   TZ=GMT sccs cvt -V6 SCCS
	   sccs cvt -V4 -d SCCS

       But note that this conversion may not be correctly converted back to
       GMT in case that time stamps exists in the overlapping period of wall
       clock time that appears when switching from DST to non-DST.
