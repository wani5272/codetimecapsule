NAME
       sccs-delget, sccs-deledit - perform a delta and get new version

SYNOPSIS
       sccs delget [options] file ...
       sccs deledit [options] file ...

DESCRIPTION
       sccs delget performs an `sccs delta' on the named files and then an
       `sccs get' to check in a delta and to retrieve new version.  The new
       versions will have id keywords expanded, and will not be editable.
       sccs performs a delta on all the files specified in the argument list,
       and then a get on all the files. If an error occurs during the delta,
       the get is not performed.  The -m, -o, -p, -r, -f, -q, -s, and -y flags
       will be passed to delta, and the -b, -c, -e, -i, -k, -l, -s, and -x
       flags will be passed to get.



       sccs deledit is equivalent to sccs delget except that the get phase
       includes the -e flag.  This is equivalent to an `sccs delta' and then
       an `sccs edit'.	deledit checks in a delta, and checks the file back
       out again, but leaves the current working copy of the file intact.
       This option is useful for making a ``checkpoint'' of your current
       editing phase.  The same flags will be passed to delta as described
       above, and all the flags listed for get above except -e and -k are
       passed to edit.

OPTIONS
       -o	   Retrieves the file under the original time of the requested
		   version.

		   Use this option with care, as it may be in conflict with
		   make(1) rules. Using `get -o' thus may cause make to
		   perform an automatic retrieval of the latest version as the
		   s.file is newer than the gotten file, or cause make to skip
		   the compilation as the compilation result is already newer
		   than the gotten file.

       -s	   Suppresses all output normally written on the standard
		   output. However, fatal error messages (which always go to
		   the standard error) remain unaffected.

       -f	   In NSE mode, force to create a delta even when no p.	 file
		   is present.

       -q	   Switch on NSE mode.


       -y[comment] Supply a comment for the delta commentary.  If -y is
		   omitted, delta prompts for a comment.  A null comment
		   results in an empty comment field for the delta.

       The options -f and -q are SCHILY extensions that do not exist in
       historic sccs implementations.


EXAMPLES
       To check in a new delta for the file xec.c in the current directory
       call:

	      sccs delget xec.c

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables
       that affect the execution of sccs-delget(1) and sccs-deledit(1): LANG,
       LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.


       SCCS_NO_HELP
	      If set, sccs delget end sccs deledit will not automatically call
	      help(1) with the SCCS error code in order to print a more
	      helpful error message. Scripts that depend on the exact error
	      messages of SCCS commands should set the environment variable
	      SCCS_NO_HELP and set LC_ALL=C.
