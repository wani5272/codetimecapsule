NAME
       sccs-sccsdiff, sccsdiff - compare two versions of an SCCS file

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/ccs/bin/sccsdiff [-p] -rsid -rsid [diff-options]
	   [-Nbulk-spec] s.filename


DESCRIPTION
       sccsdiff compares two versions of an SCCS file and displays the
       differences between the two versions. Any number of SCCS files may be
       specified. The options specified apply to all named s.files.


OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:


       -p	    Pipe output for each file through pr(1).


       -rsid	    Specify a version corresponding to the indicated SCCS
		    delta ID (SID) for comparison.  Versions are passed to
		    diff(1) in the order given.


       diff-options Pass options to diff(1), including: -b, -c, -e, -f, -h,
		    -u, -C number, -U number, and -D string.



       -Nbulk-spec  Processes a bulk of SCCS history files.  This option
		    allows to do an efficient mass processing of SCCS history
		    files.

		    The bulk-spec parameter is composed from an optional list
		    of flag parameters followed by an optional path specifier.

		    The following flag types are supported:

		    none

		    The following path specifier types are supported:

		    -N	      The file name parameters to the sccsdiff command
			      are not s.filename files but the names of the g-
			      files.  The s.filename names are automatically
			      derived from the g-file names by prepending s.
			      to the last path name component.	Both,
			      s.filename and the g-file are in the same
			      directory.

		    -Ns.      The file name parameters to the sccsdiff command
			      are s.filename files.  The the g-files names are
			      automatically derived by removing s.  from the
			      beginning of last path name component of the
			      s.filename.  Both, s.filename and the g-file are
			      in the same directory.

		    -Ndir     The file name parameters to the sccsdiff command
			      are not s.filename files but the names of the g-
			      files.  The s.filename names are put into
			      directory dir, the names are automatically
			      derived from the g-file names by prepending
			      dir/s.  to the last path name component.

		    -Ndir/s.  The file name parameters to the sccsdiff command
			      are s.filename files in directory dir.  The the
			      g-files names are automatically derived by
			      removing dir/s.  from the beginning of last path
			      name component of the s.filename.

		    A typical value for dir is SCCS.

		    In order to overcome the limited number of exec(2)
		    arguments, it is recommended to use `-' as the file name
		    parameter for sccsdiff(1) and to send a list of path names
		    to stdin.

		    This option is a SCHILY extension that does not exist in
		    historic sccs implementations.


       -V
       -version
       --version    Prints the sccsdiff version number string and exists.

		    This option is a SCHILY extension that does not exist in
		    historic sccs implementations.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables
       that affect the execution of sccsdiff(1): LANG, LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE,
       LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.


       SCCS_NO_HELP
	      If set, sccsdiff(1) will not automatically call help(1) with the
	      SCCS error code in order to print a more helpful error message.
	      Scripts that depend on the exact error messages of SCCS commands
	      should set the environment variable SCCS_NO_HELP and set
	      LC_ALL=C.


FILES
       /tmp/get?????  temporary files

DIAGNOSTICS
       filename: No differences	  If the two versions are the same.



       Use the SCCS help command for explanations of other messages. See

AUTHORS
       The SCCS suite was originally written by Marc J. Rochkind at Bell Labs
       in 1972.	 Release 4.0 of SCCS, introducing new versions of the programs
       admin(1), get(1), prt(1), and delta(1) was published on February 18,
       1977; it introduced the new text based SCCS v4 history file format
       (previous SCCS releases used a binary history file format).  The SCCS
       suite was later maintained by various people at AT&T and Sun
       Microsystems.  Since 2006, the SCCS suite is maintained by Joerg
       Schilling.
