NAME
       sccs-comb, comb - combine SCCS deltas

SYNOPSIS
       /usr/ccs/bin/comb [-os] [-csid-list] [-psid]
	   [-Xextended-options] [-Nbulk-spec] s.filename...


DESCRIPTION
       comb generates a shell script (see sh(1)) that you can use to
       reconstruct the indicated s.files.  This script is written to the
       standard output.


       If a directory name is used in place of the s.filename argument, the
       comb command applies to all s.files in that directory. Unreadable
       s.files produce an error; processing continues with the next file (if
       any). The use of `-' as the s.filename argument indicates that the
       names of files are to be read from the standard input, one s.file per
       line.


       If no options are specified, comb preserves only the most recent (leaf)
       delta in a branch, and the minimal number of ancestors needed to
       preserve the history.


OPTIONS
       The following options are supported:


       -o	    For each `get -e' generated, access the reconstructed file
		    at the release of the delta to be created. Otherwise, the
		    reconstructed file is accessed at the most recent
		    ancestor. The use of -o may decrease the size of the
		    reconstructed s.file.  It may also alter the shape of the
		    delta tree of the original file.


       -s	    Generate scripts to gather statistics, rather than
		    combining deltas. When run, the shell scripts report: the
		    file name, size (in blocks) after combining, original size
		    (also in blocks), and the percentage size change, computed
		    by the formula:


		      100 * ( original - combined ) / original


		    This option can be used to calculate the space that will
		    be saved, before actually doing the combining.


       -csid-list   Include the indicated list of deltas.  All other deltas
		    are omitted.  sid-list is a comma-separated list of SCCS
		    delta IDs (SIDs). To specify a range of deltas, use a `-'
		    separator instead of a comma, between two SIDs in the
		    list.


       -pSID	    The SID of the oldest delta to be preserved.



       -Nbulk-spec  Processes a bulk of SCCS history files.  This option
		    allows to do an efficient mass processing of SCCS history
		    files.

		    The bulk-spec parameter is composed from an optional list
		    of flag parameters followed by an optional path specifier.

		    The following flag types are supported:

		    ++	      If bulk-spec is preceded by a `++', comb(1)
			      expects to process filenames that are prepended
			      by a plus sign, the related SID and another plus
			      sign following the form:

				  +sid+filename

			      This permits each file to be retrieved with an
			      individual SID.

		    space     This is a placeholder dummy flag that allows to
			      use a prepared string for the -N option and to
			      replace the space character by one of the
			      supported flags on demand.

		    The following path specifier types are supported:

		    -N	      The file name parameters to the comb command are
			      not s.filename files but the names of the g-
			      files.  The s.filename names are automatically
			      derived from the g-file names by prepending s.
			      to the last path name component.	Both,
			      s.filename and the g-file are in the same
			      directory.

		    -Ns.      The file name parameters to the comb command are
			      s.filename files.	 The the g-files names are
			      automatically derived by removing s.  from the
			      beginning of last path name component of the
			      s.filename.  Both, s.filename and the g-file are
			      in the same directory.

		    -Ndir     The file name parameters to the comb command are
			      not s.filename files but the names of the g-
			      files.  The s.filename names are put into
			      directory dir, the names are automatically
			      derived from the g-file names by prepending
			      dir/s.  to the last path name component.

		    -Ndir/s.  The file name parameters to the comb command are
			      s.filename files in directory dir.  The the g-
			      files names are automatically derived by
			      removing dir/s.  from the beginning of last path
			      name component of the s.filename.

		    A typical value for dir is SCCS.

		    In order to overcome the limited number of exec(2)
		    arguments, it is recommended to use `-' as the file name
		    parameter for comb(1) and to send a list of path names to
		    stdin.

		    This option is a SCHILY extension that does not exist in
		    historic sccs implementations.


       -Xextended-options
		    Specify extended options. The argument extended-options
		    may be a comma separated list of extended option names.

		    The following extended options are supported, they may be
		    abbreviated as long ad the abbreviation is still unique.
		    Options with parameter may not be abbreviated.


		    0	   When reading filenames from stdin, triggered by a
			   file name argument `-', the filename separator is a
			   null byte instead of a newline.  This allows to use
			   long lists with arbitrary filenames.

		    help   Print a short online help for available options.

		    The -X option is a SCHILY extension that does not exist in
		    historic sccs implementations.


       -V
       -version
       --version    Prints the comb version number string and exists.

		    This option is a SCHILY extension that does not exist in
		    historic sccs implementations.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables
       that affect the execution of comb(1): LANG, LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE,
       LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.


       SCCS_NO_HELP
	      If set, comb(1) will not automatically call help(1) with the
	      SCCS error code in order to print a more helpful error message.
	      Scripts that depend on the exact error messages of SCCS commands
	      should set the environment variable SCCS_NO_HELP and set
	      LC_ALL=C.


EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values are returned:


       0    Successful completion.


       1    An error occurred.


FILES
       s.COMB	  reconstructed SCCS file



       comb?????  temporary file


       dump.core  If the file dump.core exists in the current directory and a
		  fatal signal is received, a coredump is initiated via
		  abort(3).

BUGS
       comb may rearrange the shape of the tree of deltas.  It may not save
       any space; in fact, it is possible for the reconstructed file to
       actually be larger than the original.


AUTHORS
       The SCCS suite was originally written by Marc J. Rochkind at Bell Labs
       in 1972.	 Release 4.0 of SCCS, introducing new versions of the programs
       admin(1), get(1), prt(1), and delta(1) was published on February 18,
       1977; it introduced the new text based SCCS v4 history file format
       (previous SCCS releases used a binary history file format).  The SCCS
       suite was later maintained by various people at AT&T and Sun
       Microsystems.  Since 2006, the SCCS suite is maintained by Joerg
       Schilling.
