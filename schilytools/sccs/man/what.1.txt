NAME
       what - extract SCCS version information from a file

SYNOPSIS
       what [-s] filename...


DESCRIPTION
       The what utility searches each filename for occurrences of the pattern
       @(#) that the SCCS get command (see sccs-get(1)) substitutes for the
       %Z% ID keyword, and prints what follows up to a ", >, NEWLINE, \, or
       NULL character.


OPTIONS
       The following option is supported:


       -s     Stops after the first occurrence of the pattern.


       -V
       -version
       --version
	      Prints the what version number string and exists.

	      This option is a SCHILY extension that does not exist in
	      historic sccs implementations.


EXAMPLES
       Example 1 Extracting SCCS version information


       If a C program in file program.c contains


	 char sccsid[] = "@(#)identification information";


       and program.c is compiled to yield program.o and a.out, the command:


	 example% what program.c program.o a.out


       produces:


       program.c:  identification information


       program.o:  identification information


       a.out:	   identification information

BUGS
       There is a remote possibility that a spurious occurrence of the `@(#)'
       pattern could be found by what.


AUTHORS
       The SCCS suite was originally written by Marc J. Rochkind at Bell Labs
       in 1972.	 Release 4.0 of SCCS, introducing new versions of the programs
       admin(1), get(1), prt(1), and delta(1) was published on February 18,
       1977; it introduced the new text based SCCS v4 history file format
       (previous SCCS releases used a binary history file format).  The SCCS
       suite was later maintained by various people at AT&T and Sun
       Microsystems.  Since 2006, the SCCS suite is maintained by Joerg
       Schilling.
