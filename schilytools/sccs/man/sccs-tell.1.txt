NAME
       sccs-check, sccs-info, sccs-tell - print information about file being
       edited

SYNOPSIS
       sccs check [options] [directory]
       sccs info [options] [directory]
       sccs tell [options] [directory]

DESCRIPTION
       sccs check checks for files currently being edited. Like info and tell,
       but returns an exit code, rather than producing a listing of files.
       check returns a non-zero exit status if anything is being edited.  The
       intent is to have this included in an ``install'' entry in a makefile
       to insure that everything is included into the SCCS file before a
       version is installed.

       sccs info displays a list of files being edited, including the version
       number checked out, the version to be checked in, the name of the user
       who holds the lock, and the date and time the file was checked out.

       If the -b flag is given, branches (i.e., SID's with two or fewer
       components) are ignored.	 If the -u flag is given (with an optional
       argument) then only files being edited by you (or the named user) are
       listed.

       sccs tell displays the list of files that are currently checked out,
       one file per line.





       If no directory argument is given, the current working directory is
       used.

OPTIONS
   /usr/bin/sccs
       check [-b] [-u[username] ]

   /usr/xpg4/bin/sccs
       check [-b] [-u [username] | -U ]


       -b

	      Ignore branches.


       -u[username] | -u [username] | -U

	      Check only files being edited by you.  When username is
	      specified, check only files being edited by that user. For
	      /usr/xpg4/bin/sccs, the -U option is equivalent to -u
	      <current_user>.

EXAMPLES
       To create a list of files currently being edited, call:

	      sccs tell

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables
       that affect the execution of sccs-check(1), sccs-info(1) and
       sccs-tell(1): LANG, LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.


       SCCS_NO_HELP
	      If set, sccs check, sccs info and sccs tell will not
	      automatically call help(1) with the SCCS error code in order to
	      print a more helpful error message. Scripts that depend on the
	      exact error messages of SCCS commands should set the environment
	      variable SCCS_NO_HELP and set LC_ALL=C.
