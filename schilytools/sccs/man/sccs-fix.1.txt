NAME
       sccs-fix - remove the indicated delta from the SCCS history

SYNOPSIS
       sccs fix [options] [file1 .. filen]

DESCRIPTION
       The fix subcommand essentially removes the named delta, but it is only
       able to revise a leaf delta.  It removes the indicated delta from the
       SCCS history, but leaves a working copy of the current version in the
       directory.

       This is useful for fixing small compiler bugs, for incorporating
       trivial updates for which no audit record is needed, or for revising
       the delta commentary.  sccs fix must be followed by a -r option, to
       specify the SID of the delta to remove.	The indicated delta must be
       the most recent (leaf) delta in its branch. Use fix with caution since
       it does not leave an audit trail of differences (although the previous
       commentary is retained within the history file).



OPTIONS
       -d     Fully discard the delta.	By default only the file content for
	      the related SID is removed and the delta table entry is changed
	      to the new type `R'.  When in discard mode, the delta table
	      entry is also completely discarded.

       -rsid  Specify the SID (see sccs-get(1)).



EXAMPLES
       To fix release 1.17 iof the file xec.c in the current directory, call:

	      sccs fix -r1.17 xec.c

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables
       that affect the execution of sccs-fix(1): LANG, LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE,
       LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.


       SCCS_NO_HELP
	      If set, sccs fix will not automatically call help(1) with the
	      SCCS error code in order to print a more helpful error message.
	      Scripts that depend on the exact error messages of SCCS commands
	      should set the environment variable SCCS_NO_HELP and set
	      LC_ALL=C.
