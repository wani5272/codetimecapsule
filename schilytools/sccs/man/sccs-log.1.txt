NAME
       sccs-log, sccslog - create changelog from SCCS history files

SYNOPSIS
       sccslog [options] s.file1 .. s.filen

DESCRIPTION
       Sccslog creates a Changelog file from SCCS history files.

       If a file argument refers to a directory, the directory is scanned for
       file names that start with ``s.'' and examines all these files.

       This program is a SCHILY extension that does not exist in historic sccs
       implementations.

OPTIONS
       -a     sccslog normally collects all deltas with the same delta comment
	      and prints them as one log table entry in case the related delta
	      time for the files differs no more than one day. With -a,
	      sccslog collects only those deltas that have been created within
	      60 seconds.

       -aa    With -aa, sccslog collects only deltas that have been created in
	      the same second.

       -Cdir  Use dir as base directory for printed file names in the output.
	      This option is used by sccs -R to tell sccslog to print
	      filenames that are suitable for complete project changelog
	      files.

       maxdelta=time-spec
	      Set up a dedicated time delta while collecting deltas with the
	      same delta comment to prints them as one log table entry.

	      If n is a simple number, the delta is set to the number of
	      seconds.

	      If n is a number like 3h10m then it is representing a number of
	      seconds that is evaluated as a human readable time spec.	The
	      letters that are recognised in the time spec are taken from
	      smhdwy with the following meaning for time units:

	      s	     seconds

	      m	     minutes (60 seconds)

	      h	     hours (60 minutes)

	      d	     days (24 hours)

	      w	     weeks (7 days)

	      y	     years (365 days - a non-leap year)

	      If neither maxdelta=time-spec nor -a are specified, the default
	      time delta is one day.

       -multfile
	      Allow multiple versions of the same file in a commit.  By
	      default, when bundling SCCS deltas with the same delta comment,
	      each file can only appear once. When -multfile has been
	      specified, the same file can appear multiple times if the delta
	      comment is the same.

       -p subdir
	      Tell sccslog to use subdir when dealing with file names.

       -R     Inverts the order of the output. This prints older entries
	      first.

       usermap=file
	      Use file instead of the default user map file.  This allowd to
	      create dedicated user map files for projects, e.g. to convert
	      the CSRG BSD source code history. See FILES section for the
	      format of the file.

       -x     Print all comment lines, even those lines that start with ^Ac_
	      and thus are no real comment but represent SCCS v6 metadata that
	      has been wrapped as comment to survive modifications by SCCS v4
	      programs.	 Such wrapped data is file specific and will prevent
	      to find more files with the same delta comment.

       -help  Prints a short summary of the sccslog options and exists.



       -Nbulk-spec
	      Processes a bulk of SCCS history files.  This option allows to
	      do an efficient mass processing of SCCS history files.

	      The bulk-spec parameter is composed from an optional list of
	      flag parameters followed by an optional path specifier.

	      The following flag types are supported:

	      none

	      The following path specifier types are supported:

	      -N	The file name parameters to the sccslog command are
			not s.filename files but the names of the g-files.
			The s.filename names are automatically derived from
			the g-file names by prepending s.  to the last path
			name component.	 Both, s.filename and the g-file are
			in the same directory.

	      -Ns.	The file name parameters to the sccslog command are
			s.filename files.  The the g-files names are
			automatically derived by removing s.  from the
			beginning of last path name component of the
			s.filename.  Both, s.filename and the g-file are in
			the same directory.

	      -Ndir	The file name parameters to the sccslog command are
			not s.filename files but the names of the g-files.
			The s.filename names are put into directory dir, the
			names are automatically derived from the g-file names
			by prepending dir/s.  to the last path name component.

	      -Ndir/s.	The file name parameters to the sccslog command are
			s.filename files in directory dir.  The the g-files
			names are automatically derived by removing dir/s.
			from the beginning of last path name component of the
			s.filename.

	      A typical value for dir is SCCS.

	      In order to overcome the limited number of exec(2) arguments, it
	      is recommended to use `-' as the file name parameter for
	      sccslog(1) and to send a list of path names to stdin.


       -Xextended-options
	      Specify extended options. The argument extended-options may be a
	      comma separated list of extended option names.

	      The following extended options are supported, they may be
	      abbreviated as long ad the abbreviation is still unique. Options
	      with parameter may not be abbreviated.


	      0	     When reading filenames from stdin, triggered by a file
		     name argument `-', the filename separator is a null byte
		     instead of a newline.  This allows to use long lists with
		     arbitrary filenames.

	      help   Print a short online help for available options.

	      The -X option is a SCHILY extension that does not exist in
	      historic sccs implementations.


       -V
       -version
       --version
	      Prints the sccslog version number string and exists.

EXAMPLES
       To creates a changelog for all SCCS history files in directory SCCS
       call:

	      sccslog SCCS/s.*

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables
       that affect the execution of val(1): LANG, LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE,
       LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.


       SCCS_NO_HELP
	      If set, admin(1) will not automatically call help(1) with the
	      SCCS error code in order to print a more helpful error message.
	      Scripts that depend on the exact error messages of SCCS commands
	      should set the environment variable SCCS_NO_HELP and set
	      LC_ALL=C.

FILES
       $HOME/.sccs/usermap
	      This file contains a map list from user names to user
	      descriptions.  It consists of a list of lines (each for one
	      user) that start with a user name, followed by white space and a
	      user description.	 It may e.g. look like:

	      joerg   Joerg Schilling <schily@somewhere.com>
	      ronnie  Ronnie Nowhere <ronnie@nowhere.com>
