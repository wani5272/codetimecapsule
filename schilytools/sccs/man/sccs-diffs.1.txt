NAME
       sccs-diffs -  compare the working copy of a file with the SCCS history

SYNOPSIS
       sccs diffs [options] [file1 .. filen]
       sccs ldiffs [options] [file1 .. filen]

DESCRIPTION
       The diffs subcommand compares (in diff(1) format) the working copy of a
       file that is checked out for editing, with a version from the SCCS
       history.	 sccs diffs uses the most recent checked-in version by
       default. The diffs subcommand accepts the same options as diff.

       Any -r, -c, -i, -x, and -t options are passed to subcommand get.	 A -C
       option is passed to diff as -c.	An -I option is passed to diff as -i.

       The diffs subcommand calls the UNIX diff(1) command that is delivered
       with the SCCS packet. If you like to call the local diff(1) command
       that is in your PATH, use the ldiffs subcommand.

OPTIONS
       All diff(1) options are supported and the following SCCS options:

       -c date-time | -cdate-time
	      Use the most recent version checked in before the indicated date
	      and time for comparison.	date-time takes the form:
	      yy[mm[dd[hh[mm[ss]]]]].  Omitted units default to their maximum
	      possible values; that is -c7502 is equivalent to -c750228235959.


       -r[sid]
	      Use the version corresponding to the indicated SID (delta).

	      See sccs-get(1) formore information on the SID.


EXAMPLES
       To compare the file xec.c in the current directory with te state in the
       SCCS history call:

	      sccs diffs xec.c

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables
       that affect the execution of sccs-diffs(1): LANG, LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE,
       LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.


       SCCS_NO_HELP
	      If set, sccs diffs will not automatically call help(1) with the
	      SCCS error code in order to print a more helpful error message.
	      Scripts that depend on the exact error messages of SCCS commands
	      should set the environment variable SCCS_NO_HELP and set
	      LC_ALL=C.
