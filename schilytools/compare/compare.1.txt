NAME
       compare - fast binary comparison of two files

SYNOPSIS
       compare [ options ] file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
       Compare examines one file and standard in, or two files on a byte by
       byte basis, and prints the file position of the first difference it
       finds, first in decimal and then in hexadecimal, followed by the
       differing byte content in hexadecimal and as quoted character.

       Compare is similar to the UNIX utility cmp(1) but faster.

       The lines count from 1, the byte offset counts from 0.  This is a
       deviation from the UNIX cmp(1) utility, which counts byte offsets
       beginning from 1.

OPTIONS
       Note all options can be abbreviated to their first letter.

       -all, -a, -long, -l
	      Do not stop comparing the files if the first difference is
	      found.

       -lines,-L
	      Count lines while comparing data.	 This slows down the process
	      of comparison by a factor of two.	 The line count starts after
	      the optional initial skip on a file.
       b=#
       begin=#
	      Start comparing at byte n, otherwise at byte 0.
       b1=#
       begin1=#
	      Start comparing file 1 at byte n, otherwise at byte 0.
       b2=#
       begin2=#
	      Start comparing fle 2 at byte n, otherwise at byte 0.
       c=#
       count=#
	      Stops after comparing n bytes, otherwise if the first files
	      encounters EOF.

       -silent
	      Does not print messages, just returns the exit code.

       -help  Prints a short summary of the compare options and exists.

       -version
	      Prints the compare version number string and exists.

NOTES
       numbers in the options begin=#, begin1=#, begin2=#, and count=# are
       assumed to be bytes. However typing the character 'b' after the number
       means blocks (512 bytes). (E.g. begin=6b count=1000b). Other suffixes
       may used as for the bs= option in sdd(1) 'k' means 1024 bytes, 'm'
       means 1024 KBytes.
