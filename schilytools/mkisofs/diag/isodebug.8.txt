INTERFACE STABILITY
       The interfaces provided by readcd are designed for long term stability.
       As readcd depends on interfaces provided by the underlying operating
       system, the stability of the interfaces offered by readcd depends on
       the interface stability of the OS interfaces.  Modified interfaces in
       the OS may enforce modified interfaces in readcd.
