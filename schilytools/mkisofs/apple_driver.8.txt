NAME
       apple_driver - extract Macintosh partition label, maps and boot driver

SYNOPSIS
       apple_driver CDROM_device > HFS_driver_file

DESCRIPTION
       Apple_driver extracts the information from an Apple (or compatible) CD-
       ROM required for the -hfs-boot-file option to mkhybrid(1).

       The CDROM_device is the device name used by the CD-ROM (e.g.
       /dev/cdrom).

       The format of the HFS driver file is:

       HFS CD Label Block			     512 bytes
       Driver Partition Map (for 2048 byte blocks)   512 bytes
       Driver Partition Map (for 512 byte blocks)    512 bytes
       Empty					     512 bytes
       Driver Partition				     N x 2048 bytes
       HFS Partition Boot Block			     1024 bytes

       The Perl script hdisk.pl can be used to give a listing of what's on a
       Mac CD. hdisk.pl is part of hfsutils.

NOTE
       By using a driver from an Apple CD and copying Apple software to your
       CD, you become liable to obey Apple Computer, Inc. Software License
       Agreements.
