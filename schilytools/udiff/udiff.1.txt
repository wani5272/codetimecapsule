NAME
       udiff, fdiff, fsdiff - shows where two files differ

SYNOPSIS
       udiff [ options ] file1 file2

       fdiff [ options ] file1 file2

       fsdiff [ options ] file1 file2

DESCRIPTION
       udiff shows what lines differ between two files.	 udiff supports
       arbitrary line lengths and treats binary files the same as text files.

       It does not support many options or features and there is no best match
       resync mechanism, but the output is typically identical to the output
       from the classical UNIX diff(1).

       If called as fdiff or fsdiff, the POSIX output style is used and the
       nmatch=# resync default value is set to 1 line.

       If called as fsdiff, the exit code is compatible to bdiff(1) and
       differences in the files still result in a zero exit code; only an
       error causes a non-zero exit code.  This allows fsdiff to be used as a
       replacement for the bdiff program for SCCS.

       Since the performance of udiff is only a linear function of the file
       size, using fsdiff speeds up SCCS with large files.

       Since the differences reported by fsdiff are smaller that what bdiff
       reports, this helps to keep SCCS history files smaller.


       The normal output if called as udiff contains lines of these forms:

	 -------- 1 line deleted at %ld:
	 -------- %ld lines deleted at %ld:
	 -------- 1 line added at %ld:
	 -------- %ld lines added at %ld:
	 -------- 1 line changed at %ld from:
	 -------- %ld lines changed at %ld-%ld from:
	 -------- 1 line changed to %ld lines at %ld from:
	 -------- %ld lines changed to 1 line at %ld-%ld from:
	 -------- %ld lines changed to %ld lines at %ld-%ld from:
	 -------- to:

       followed by blocks with the changed text.  This is easier to read by
       humans than the POSIX output variant.



       The POSIX output variant contains lines of these forms:

	 n1 a n3,n4
	 n1,n2 d n3
	 n1,n2 c n3,n4



       where n1 and n2 represent lines file1 and n3 and n4 represent lines in
       file2 These lines resemble ed(1) commands to convert file1 to file2.
       By exchanging a for d and reading backward, file2 can be converted to
       file1.  As in ed, identical pairs, where n1=n2 or n3=n4, are
       abbreviated as a single number.


       Following each of these lines come all the lines that are affected in
       the first file flagged by `<', then all the lines that are affected in
       the second file flagged by `>'.

OPTIONS
       -help  Prints a short summary of the udiff options and exists.

       -version
	      Prints the udiff version number string and exists.

       nmatch=#
	      Sets the number of matching lines to resync.  If udiff is called
	      as udiff, the default is two lines, otherwise it is one line.

       -posix Output the differences in POSIX style instead of using udiff
	      style.

EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values are returned:

       0      No differences were found (udiff and fdiff only).

       0      No error occurred (fsdiff only).

       1      Differences were found (udiff and fdiff only).

       other  An error occurred.


NOTES
       No output is generated if the files are the same.
