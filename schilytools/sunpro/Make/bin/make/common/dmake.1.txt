NAME
       dmake - parallel make from Distributed Make

SYNOPSIS
       dmake [-c dmake-rcfile] [-g dmake-group] [-j dmake-max-jobs]
	     [-m {serial | parallel}] [-x MODE_NAME=VALUE]
	     [-o dmake-odir] [-R]

DESCRIPTION
       This man page supplements the man page for the Solaris make(1s)
       utility.

       This version of dmake(1) implements a subset of the features of the
       dmake(1) program delivered with the Sun Studio compiler suite.  It
       implements serial and parallel mode, but neither the distributed nor
       the grid mode.


OPTIONS
       -c dmake-rcfile	       This version of dmake neither supports the
			       default configuration file $(HOME)/.dmakerc nor
			       an alternate location specified by the -c
			       option.

       -g dmake-group	       This version of dmake does not support to set a
			       dmake group via the -g option.

       -j dmake-max-jobs       Specifies the maximum total number of jobs that
			       are run in parallel.

			       The environment DMAKE_ADJUST_MAX_JOBS and the
			       command line macro of the same name manage the
			       way make controls the number of jobs.  See the
			       chapter ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES for more
			       information.

       -m {serial | parallel}  Allows to specify one of the following key
			       words:

			       serial	 Causes dmake to behave like the
					 standard serial version of make.

			       parallel	 Causes dmake to run several jobs in
					 parallel on the dmake host.

       -o dmake-odir	       This version of dmake does not support to set a
			       common physical directory via the -o option.

       -O filedesc	       This version of dmake does not support to set a
			       file descriptor to send job start and result
			       messages to using the -O option.

       -R		       Do not run in parallel mode.

       -x SUN_MAKE_COMPAT_MODE=value
       -x DMAKE_OUTPUT_MODE=value
			       Allows to set the dmake compat mode or the
			       output mode.  See ENVIRONMENT for more
			       information.


USAGE
       For the general usage, see the make(1s) man page for more information.


   Special-purpose Targets
       dmake supports the special targets .PARALLEL, .NO_PARALLEL,
       .NOTPARALLEL, .LOCAL, and .WAIT to control the way the targets are
       made.


       .NO_PARALLEL:	Add targets to the dependency list of this target to
			control which targets are to be processed serially.

       .NOTPARALLEL:	When this special target is seen in a makefile, all
			targets in this dmake instance are processed serially.
			Sub-makes may still run in parallel mode.

       .PARALLEL:	Add targets to the dependency list of this target to
			control which targets are to be processed in parallel.

       .LOCAL:		Add targets to the dependency list of this target to
			control which targets are to be processed serially on
			the local host.	 This version of dmake does not
			support distributed builds.

       .WAIT		When this target is specified in a dependency list,
			dmake waits until the dependencies to the left of the
			.WAIT pseudo target are finished before starting to
			process targets to the right of .WAIT.


ENVIRONMENT/MACROS
       DMAKE_ADJUST_MAX_JOBS
	      This macro allows to control the parallel make behavior.	The
	      macro DMAKE_ADJUST_MAX_JOBS may either be imported from the
	      environment or specified on the command line.  The following
	      values are possible:

	      YES    This is the same as specifying DMAKE_ADJUST_MAX_JOBS=M1

	      NO     The number of jobs is not adjusted based on the load of
		     the system or the total number of jobs.

	      M1     Allow dmake to control the number of jobs based on the
		     current system load.  If the load is high, the number of
		     jobs will be reduced.  If the load is low, the number of
		     jobs specified by the user is used.

		     This is the default method used to control the number of
		     jobs.

	      M2     The number of jobs is adjusted based on the total number
		     of jobs run by the current group of running make
		     programs.	This is implemented via shared memory that is
		     set up between recursively called make programs.

       DMAKE_GROUP
	      This version of dmake does not support to set a dmake group via
	      the DMAKE_GROUP environment or macro.

       DMAKE_MAX_JOBS
	      Allows to set the maximum number of jobs in case that -j was not
	      specified.

       DMAKE_MODE
	      May contain one of the following key words:

	      serial	Causes dmake to behave like the standard serial
			version of make.

	      parallel	Causes dmake to run several jobs in parallel on the
			dmake host.

       DMAKE_ODIR
	      This version of dmake does not support to set the dmake-odir via
	      the DMAKE_ODIR environment or macro.

       DMAKE_OUTPUT_MODE
	      Controls the output format used by dmake.	 The following values
	      are possible:

	      TXT1    The default behavior.  Serialize stdout and stderr, and
		      print a label before the output from a new job starts.

	      TXT2    Serialize stdout and stderr, but do not print the labels
		      from TXT1 mode.

       DMAKE_RCFILE
	      This version of dmake neither supports the default configuration
	      file $(HOME)/.dmakerc nor an alternate location specified by the
	      DMAKE_RCFILE environment or macro.

       __DMAKE_M2_FILE__
	      If DMAKE_ADJUST_MAX_JOBS is set to M2, this environment variable
	      holds a handle to the shared memory that is used to manage the
	      job pool. Do never set this environment variable.

       For other ENVIRONMENT/MACROS variables, see the make(1s) man page.
