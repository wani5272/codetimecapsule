NAME
       translit - translates characters

SYNOPSIS
       translit [ options ] from_string to_string [file1 ... filen]

DESCRIPTION
       Translit performs a character substitution, changing the characters
       specified in the from_string to the corresponding characters in the
       to_string.  Since the mapping is done one to one, the from_string must
       be equal to or larger than the to_string.  If the from_string is
       larger, the end of the from set is mapped to the last character of the
       to set.

       The files are not modified, all output is written to standard out.  If
       no files are specified, translit reads from standard input.

OPTIONS
       -help  Prints a short summary of the translit options and exists.

       -version
	      Prints the translit version number string and exists.

       -c     Complement the set of values specified by from_string.

       -d     Delete all occurrences of input characters that are specified in
	      from_string.

       -s     Replace instances of repeated characters that are specified in
	      from_string with a single character.  If the -d option has also
	      been specified, the character set is taken from to_string.


OPERANDS
       The following notations of characters are supported:

       c       Any single byte character not described below
       \ddd    Represents octal notations of characters
       \\      Represents the backslash
       \a      Represents the audible bell
       \b      Represents the backspace character
       \f      Represents the formfeed character
       \n      Represents the newline character
       \r      Represents the carriage return character
       \t      Represents the tab character
       \v      Represents the vertical tab character

NOTES
       When the to_string is smaller than the from_string, multiple
       occurrences of the folded characters are not generated.	Translating
       all letters, white space and punctuation, to X's, for example, will
       cause only a single X to appear on the output stream.

       If the to_string is empty, all occurrences of input characters that are
       specified in from_string are deleted and produce no output.

       You can use reverse ranges,

	      translit [a-z] [z-a]

       will change every a to z and every z to a and so forth.

       If an ordinary digit in the octal range is following an octal sequence,
       the octal sequence must use three octal digits.

       If from_string or to_string start with the unescaped character '^', the
       related set is complemented.
