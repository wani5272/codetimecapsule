COUNT(1L)		    Schily's USER COMMANDS		     COUNT(1L)

NAME
       count - counts items in a file

SYNOPSIS
       count [ options ] file1 ... filen

DESCRIPTION
       Count reads all of the specified files and produces one line of output
       for each input file: the number of the characters, the number of
       'words', and the number of lines in the specified files. 'Words' is an
       arbitrary term in reference to programs, because they tend to have a
       lot of punctuation. For text files a word is a sequence of characters
       separated by white space.

       If more than one file is given, a grand total is also printed.  If no
       filenames are given, count reads from standard input. Any combination
       of options works; the default is (-c -w -l -llen -t).

OPTIONS
       All options except tab= and -llen can be abbreviated to their first
       letter.	The option -llen can be abbreviated with -ll.

       -chars	 Counts characters based on bytes.

       -mchars	 Counts multi byte characters.

       -words	 Counts words.

       -lines	 Counts lines.

       -llen	 Counts maximum line length.

       tab=tab width
		 Set the width of a tab to tab width for counting maximum line
		 length.

       -stat	 Use stat(2) system call to get the character count of a file.
		 This is much faster but cannot count anything but characters.

       -total	 Grand totals of several files.

       -help	 Prints a short summary of the count options and exists.

       -version	 Prints the count version number string and exists.
