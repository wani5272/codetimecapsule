NAME
       printf - write formatted output

SYNOPSIS
       printf format [argument]...

DESCRIPTION
       The printf command writes formatted operands to the standard output.
       The argument operands are formatted under control of the format
       operand.	 The format operand is treated like a printf(3) format string
       and the escape sequences '\a', '\b', '\f', '\n', '\r', '\t', '\v', '\\'
       and '\ddd', where ddd is one to three octal digits, are expanded as if
       they were in a C string.

       In addition to the format specifiers %c, %s, %d, %i, %o, %u, %x, %X,
       %e, %E, %f, %F, %g, %G, the format %b is supported.  The integers are
       handled internally as intmax_t to avoid range problems even though only
       the standard int type specifiers are supported in the format operand.
       The format %b is treated like %s except that escape sequences in the
       argument string are expanded as with the echo command.

       Field width and precision may be specified either numerically in the
       format operand or via the '*' format specifier and related arguments.

       The printf(3) flag characters '+', ' ', '#' and '0' are supported.

       The format strings %n$ and *m$, where n or m are decimal integers in
       the range 1 ..  maxargs, allow to specify the position in the parameter
       list.  See printf(3) for more information.

       The format operand is reused as often as necessary to satisfy the
       argument operands.  If the format operand contains more format
       specifiers than argument operands have been specified, string formats
       are treated as if an empty string has been supplied and integer
       arguments are treated as if a 0 has been supplied.
