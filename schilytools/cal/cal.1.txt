NAME
       cal - display a calendar

SYNOPSIS
       cal [ [month] year]


DESCRIPTION
       The cal utility writes a Julian or Gregorian calendar to standard
       output. If the year operand is specified, a calendar for that year is
       written. If no operands are specified, a calendar for the current month
       is written.

       The date to switch from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar
       is controlled by the environment variable GREGORIAN and the current
       locale.


OPERANDS
       The following operands are supported:


       month	 Specify the month to be displayed, represented as a decimal
		 integer from 1 (January) to 12 (December). The default is the
		 current month.


       year	 Specify the year for which the calendar is displayed,
		 represented as a decimal integer from 1 to 9999.  The default
		 is the current year.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       See environ(5) for descriptions of the following environment variables
       that affect the execution of cal: LANG, LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LC_TIME,
       LC_MESSAGES, and NLSPATH.


       TZ	 Determine the timezone used to calculate the value of the
		 current month.


       GREGORIAN Unless LC_ALL or LC_TIME have been set to C, the environment
		 GREGORIAN allows to specify a switch date to change from the
		 Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar. The argument must
		 be in the form:

		      yyyy/mm/dd

		 or

		      yyyy-mm-dd

		 and holds the day of the switch based on the Julian calendar.
		 For the catholic parts of the Holy Roman Empire, this would
		 be 1582/10/05 as October 5th was replaced by October 15th in
		 1582.	For Prussia (Berlin), this would be 1612/08/23 as
		 August 23th was replaced by September 2th in 1612.

		 If GREGORIAN was not set or when in the C locale, the switch
		 to the Gregorian calendar appears as if GREGORIAN was set to
		 1752/9/3.  This is to make cal(1) compatible to the historic
		 UNIX definition.

		 A leading + sign in GREGORIAN allows to enforce the switch
		 date even when in the C locale.


EXIT STATUS
       The following exit values are returned:


       0	 Successful completion.



       >0	 An error occurred.

NOTES
       In case that the environment GREGORIAN is not active, an unusual
       calendar is printed for September 1752. That is the month 11 days were
       skipped in the Kingdom of Great Britain and their colonies to make up
       for lack of leap year adjustments. To see this calendar, type:

	 cal 9 1752




       The command cal 83 refers to the year 83, not 1983.


       The year is always considered to start in January.
