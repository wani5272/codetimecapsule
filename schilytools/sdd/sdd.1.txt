NAME
       sdd - disk dump and restore to and from tape or file; copy and/or
       reblock

SYNOPSIS
       sdd [ option=value ] [ -flag ]

DESCRIPTION
       Sdd copies the specified input file to a specified output file
       performing the requested conversions. The standard input and output are
       used by default.	 The input and output block size may be specified to
       take advantage of raw physical I/O.

       After completion, sdd reports the number of whole records, the sum of
       bytes from partial input and output blocks and the total amount in kilo
       bytes on inout and output.

       If ibs and obs differ, sdd is faster than dd due to the use of an
       intelligent algorithm.

OPTIONS
       -help  Print a summary of the available options.

       if=name
	      Input is taken from file name; default is stdin.

	      If sdd is installed suid root, name may be in remote syntax:
	      user@host:filename as in rcp(1) even if invoked by non root
	      users.  See SUID NOTES for more information.

	      To make a file local although it includes a colon (:), the
	      filename must start with: '/', './' or '../'

       of=name
	      Output is taken from file name; default is stdout.  Note that
	      sdd creates and truncates the output file by default; therefore
	      the oseek=# option is useless without the -notrunc option except
	      in special cases such as using magnetic tape or disk special
	      files.

	      If sdd is installed suid root, name may be in remote syntax:
	      user@host:filename as in rcp(1) even if invoked by non root
	      users.

	      Note that if sdd talks to an old rmt remote tape server, it does
	      not open a remote file with the O_CREAT open flag because this
	      would be extremely dangerous.  If the rmt server on the other
	      side is the rmt server that comes with star or the GNU rmt
	      server, sdd may use the symbolic mode for the open flags.	 Only
	      the symbolic open modes allow to send all possible open modes in
	      a portable way to remote tape servers.

	      It is recommended to use the rmt server that comes with star.
	      It is the only rmt server that gives platform independent
	      compatibility with BSD, Sun and GNU rmt clients and it includes
	      security features that may be set up in /etc/default/rmt.


       -inull Do not read input from file.  This is similar to if=/dev/zero
	      but much faster.	Sdd uses a prepared cleared buffer to satisfy
	      writes.

       -onull Do not produce any output. This is similar to of=/dev/null but
	      actually does not write to any file.

       ibs=#, obs=#, bs=#
	      Set input block size, output block size or both to # (default
	      512 Bytes).

       cbs=#  Set Conversion buffer size to #.

       ivsize=#, ovsize=#
	      Set input volume size or output volume size to #. You can make
	      copies from devices of different size by using this option. If
	      you want to make a copy to a tape having a size of 60 MBytes you
	      should use the option ovsize=60M.	 If the capacity of the tape
	      is exceeded, sdd will ask for a second volume. In case ivsize is
	      exceeded, if N<cr> is typed, it is treated as an EOF condition
	      and sdd writes any buffered data to output and exits. In case
	      ovsize is exceeded, if N<cr> is typed, sdd stops and the
	      statistics it prints show that more data were read than written.

       count=#
	      Transfer # of input records or until EOF.

       iseek=#, iskip=#
	      Seek/skip the first # Bytes from input before beginning
	      transfer.

       oseek=#, oskip=#
	      Seek/skip the first # Bytes from output before beginning
	      transfer.

       seek=#, skip=#
	      Seek/skip the first # Bytes from input and output before
	      beginning transfer.

       ivseek=#, ovseek=#
	      Seek # Bytes from input/output at the beginning of each
	      input/output volume before beginning transfer. (You can skip
	      labels of disks and floppies with this option.)  Note that the
	      iseek/oseek options still work, but only apply to the first
	      volume.  Their values are added to the values of ivseek and
	      ovseek.

       -notrunc
	      Do not truncate an already existing output file before beginning
	      transfer.	 This enables it to copy one file into another.

       -pg    Print a dot to stderr each time a record is written to indicate
	      progress.

       secsize=#
	      Set the basic buffersize for error recovery via -noerror to #.
	      The default is 512 to match the most usual physical sector size.
	      Since error recovery is done at the level of the basic buffer
	      size, you need to use this option in error recovery mode in case
	      you are accessing a drive with a different physical sector size
	      than 512 bytes.

       -time, -t
	      Report the total time and the transfer rate.

       -noerror
	      Do not stop transfer on I/O errors. Error messages will appear
	      on the screen.  If this option is used and -noseek has not been
	      specified as well, ibs and obs need to be multiples of the error
	      recovery blocksize specified via secsize=#.

       -noerrwrite
	      Do not write blocks that are not read correctly. Seek on the
	      output to skip the bad block.  The output file must be seekable
	      or -noerrwrite will not work correctly.

       -noseek
	      Do not seek after I/O errors. This implies try=1.

       try=#  Set retry count to #.  Only if -noerror was specified. (default
	      2)

       -debug Turn on debugging messages. You can get knowledge about record
	      sizes on tapes with variable record size with this option.

       -fill  Pad every output record with zeros up to obs.  If ibs equals
	      obs, or only bs was specified, every record will be padded with
	      zeros, otherwise this only applies to the last record.

       -swab  Swaps bytes (except for the last byte in odd block sizes and odd
	      transfers due to EOF).

       -block, -unblock
	      Convert fixed length records to variable records and vice versa.

       -lcase, -ucase
	      Map alphabetics to lower/upper case.

       -ascii, -ebcdic, -ibm
	      Convert EBCDIC to ASCII resp.  ASCII to EBCDIC resp.  ASCII to
	      the IBM variant of EBCDIC.

       -help  Prints a short summary of the sdd options and exists.

       -md5   Compute the md5 sum for the data.	 If the option -onull was
	      used, sdd computes the md5 sum on the input data, otherwise the
	      output data is used.

       -version
	      Prints the sdd version number string and exists.

EXAMPLES
       sdd if=/dev/rsd0a of=/dev/nrst8 bs=2x7x17b

       Copies the disk /dev/rsd0a to the tape /dev/nrst8 using a record size
       of 2*7*17 blocks.  (this is 2 Cylinders.)

       sdd if=/dev/rsd0c of=/dev/rsd1c seek=1b bs=63k

       Copy the whole disk sd0 to sd1 preserving the old label on disk sd1.

FILES
       None.

SEE ALSO
       dd(1), star(1), rmt(1), tr(1), cp(1), copy(1)

DIAGNOSTICS
       sdd: Read  f records + p bytes (total of x bytes = d.nnk).
       sdd: Wrote f records + p bytes (total of x bytes = d.nnk).

       The number of full records, the number of bytes in partial records and
       the total amount of data in KBytes.

       With the QUIT signal ( usually ^\ ) the actual state is displayed.

NOTES
       Opposed to dd, sdd is able to handle -iseek -oseek -seek as well as
       -iskip -oskip -skip regardless to the buffer size. You can make a whole
       physical copy of a disk without copying the label in one pass of sdd.

       When numbers are unspecified the are taken to be bytes.

       You can make them `words' (2 bytes) if they are followed by a `w' or
       `W'.

       You can make them blocks (512 bytes) if they are followed by a `b' or
       `B'.

       You can make them Kbytes (1024 bytes) if they are followed by a `k' or
       `K'.

       You can make them Mbytes (1024 * 1024 bytes) if they are followed by a
       `m' or `M'.

       You can make them Gbytes (1024 * 1024 *1024 bytes) if they are followed
       by a `g' or `G'.

       A pair of numbers may be separated by `*' or `x' to indicate a product.

SUID NOTES
       If sdd is installed suid root, sdd is able to make connections to
       remote files for non root users.	 This is done by using the rcmd(3)
       interface to get a connection to a rmt(1) server.

       Sdd resets its effective uid back to the real user id immediately after
       setting up the remote connection to the rmt server and before opening
       any other file.

BUGS
       The option iskip=# and oskip=# and skip=# as well as -block and
       -unblock are not implemented.

       It is confusing to allow the use of all additions together with the
       record counter -count as they are possible with obs=#.
