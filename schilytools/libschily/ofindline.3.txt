       int ofindline(f,delim,string,field,array,arraysize)
       FILE *f;
       char delim;

       delimiter, delim, is used to break up each line of the file into
       fields. string is the string to match. fieldno is the field number to
       match. Fields are numbered 0..n. array is an array of pointers to fill
       in. arraysize is the size of array.

	      the condition findline_storage is handled and the handler
