NAME
       fileopen() - opens or creates files

SYNOPSIS
       FILE *fileopen(filename,modes)
       char *filename;
       char *modes;

DESCRIPTION
       fileopen() opens filename. The mode is specified by the characters from
       the following set:

       a      seek to end-of-file after opening

       c      create file if necessary

       r      allow read access

       t      truncate file after opening if it already exists

       u      unbuffered all read/writes directly to system

       w      allow write access

RETURNS
       NULL open failed.  other value should be used in other I/O calls and is
       of the type FILE.

NOTES
       The file is opened with rw rw access.  If there is not enough room to
       allocate a buffer, the file is opened in an unbuffered mode. There is a
       limit to the number of open files.
