GETERRNO(3)		  Schily's LIBRARY FUNCTIONS		   GETERRNO(3)

NAME
       geterrno() - gets system error number

SYNOPSIS
       int geterrno()

DESCRIPTION
       geterrno() enables the programmer to find out exactly what the last
       failure was. This is often necessary since some subroutines just
       indicate success or failure, rather than directly return definitive
       error codes.

       For example, comerr() uses geterrno() to retrieve the last error so
       that an appropriate message can be printed.

RETURNS
       Returns the error code for the last system error that occurred in the
       current process, e.g., after a call to fileopen() failed.

SEE ALSO
       comerr(3), comerrno(3), error(3), errmsg(3)

NOTES
       The value returned by geterrno() is only valid after the immediately
       preceding system call failed.
