FILELUOPEN(3)		  Schily's LIBRARY FUNCTIONS		 FILELUOPEN(3)

NAME
       fileluopen() - opens a file given a logical unit number

SYNOPSIS
       FILE *fileluopen(lu, modes)
       int lu;
       char *modes;

DESCRIPTION
       fileluopen() makes an object of type FILE, suitable for use with
       fileread(), putc(), etc.

       The lu argument is a logical unit number assigned by the kernel when it
       opens a file. Logical unit numbers are not usually visible, although
       several routines reguire LUs as arguments and fdown() may be used to
       map a FILE object to a corresponding LU number.

       The modes argument is a string encoding the modes of the file, just as
       for fileopen(), except that the 'c' and 't' options are not allowed.

RETURNS
       Returns the FILE value.

NOTES
       none
