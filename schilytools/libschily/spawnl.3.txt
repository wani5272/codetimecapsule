NAME
       spawnl() - calls a command with specified arguments

SYNOPSIS
       int spawnl(Sin,Sout,Serr,Command_Name,arg1...argn,NULL)
       FILE *Sin, *Sout, *Serr;
       char *Command_Name, *arg1...*argn;

DESCRIPTION
       spawnl() causes the named command to be called in a subsidiary process
       with the given arguments. The last argument to spawnl() must be NULL to
       indicate the end of the list. The streams Sin, Sout and Serr become
       stdin, stout, and stderr for the command.  The Command_Name may be an
       absolute or a relative pathname. To locate the command, the working
       directory is searched first, then /bin. This is a property of fexecv(),
       which spawnl() calls.

       When the command finishes, spawnl() returns to the caller.

RETURNS
       Returns 0 when successful. Otherwise, returns a non-zero value which
       could be:

       an error code from fork() or fexecl().  the argument to exit() in the
       Command_name.

       1,     if stopped by a control C (^C).

       2,     if killed by another process.

       4,     if suspended by any fault, raise, control Y ^Y or by another
	      process. (In this case, spawnl() kills the suspended process.)

NOTES
       spawnl() just calls spawnv() with the address and length of the
       argument list.
