NAME
       comerr() - prints error message and exits

SYNOPSIS
       comerr(format,arg1,...,argn)
       char *format;

DESCRIPTION
       comerr() formats and prints a message on the error output stream. Part
       of the message is the last error encountered by the system while
       executing the process.  comerr() begins its output with the current
       program name (as passed to it by exec() ) followed by a colon ":" and
       the detailed system error message. It then formats the user supplied
       format string and arguments in the form printf() would.

RETURNS
       none
       Rather than return, comerr() terminates the current process and exits
       with the system error number as the exit code.

EXAMPLES
       if (( f = fileopen("file", "r")) == NULL)
	    comerr("Cannot open file.\n");

       On stderr it appears as:

       prog_name: No such file or directory. Cannot open file.

SEE ALSO
       comerrno(3), error(3), errmsg(3), error(3) geterrno(3), printf(3),
       format(3)

NOTES
       comerr() attempts to find a line in the message file that corresponds
       to the system error number. If none can be found, or it has trouble
       finding or reading the file, it simply says: error #.
