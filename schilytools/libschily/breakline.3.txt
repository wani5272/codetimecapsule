NAME
       breakline() - breaks a buffer into fields

SYNOPSIS
       int breakline(buf, delim, array, max)
       char *buf;
       char delim;
       char *array[];
       int max;

DESCRIPTION
       breakline() breaks the buffer buf into fields delimited by the
       character delim, replacing the occurrences of delim in buf with the
       NULL character ('\0'). It fills in the array with pointers to the
       beginning of each field in the buffer. max defines how many entries to
       fill in the array. If there are not enough fields in buf, the extra
       entries in the array will point to an empty string.

RETURNS
       Returns the number of fields actually in the buffer, but not more than
       max.

EXAMPLES
       char *buf = "a:bc:d:efg";
       char *array[10];

       breakline(buf, ':', array, 10);

       now the `:' are replaced by '\0' and:

	    array[0] = "a";
	    array[1] = "bc";
	    array[2] = "d"
	    array[3] = "efg";
	    array[4] ... array[9] = "";
