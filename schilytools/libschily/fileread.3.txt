NAME
       fileread() - reads file into buffer

SYNOPSIS
       int fileread(f,buf,size)
       FILE *f;
       char *buf;
       int size;

DESCRIPTION
       fileread() reads up to size bytes from the file into buf. The number
       actually read may be smaller if end-of-file is reached.	The file
       pointer (implied) is left pointing to one past the last character read.

RETURNS
       > 0    the number of bytes actually read.

       = 0    file was at end-of-file.

       < 0    error code.

       It returns the number of bytes actually read or an error code.

NOTES
       The buffer must be at least size long. If reading from a "raw" device,
       size must be a multiple of 512.
