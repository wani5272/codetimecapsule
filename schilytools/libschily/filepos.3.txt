FILEPOS(3)		  Schily's LIBRARY FUNCTIONS		    FILEPOS(3)

NAME
       filepos() - returns the logical position in a file

SYNOPSIS
       off_t filepos(f)
       FILE *f;

DESCRIPTION
       filepos() returns the current file position as an offset in bytes from
       the beginning of the file. This is the position of the next byte to be
       read or written.

RETURNS
       Returns the current offset into file f.

NOTES
       The numbering of bytes in a file starts at 0. For byte sequential
       devices, such as a terminal, the value returned will be the number of
       bytes read or written from the current file, unless a seek call is
       issued which changes the logical position but does not affect the
       device.

       File positions may be set to arbitrary values (via fileseek()) and are
       only used by the file system when actual reading or writing occurs.

       Normally, the file position is incremented by the amount of data
       transferred for each sequential read or write.
