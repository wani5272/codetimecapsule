FDUP(3)			  Schily's LIBRARY FUNCTIONS		       FDUP(3)

NAME
       fdup() - returns new file identical to the given file

SYNOPSIS
       FILE fdup(f)
       FILE *f;

DESCRIPTION
       fdup() creates a new file stream which accesses the same file as f. The
       new file will have the same read/write/buffered attributes as the old
       file.  fdup() can be used to simultaneously read from two different
       positions in a file.

RETURNS
       Returns the duplicate file, if successful.  Returns NULL, if it could
       not create the new stream.

NOTES
       This call should be used carefully on buffered files open for writing.
       Changes made on one stream might be superseded by changes made on the
       other.
