NAME
       patmatch() - checks string for matches

SYNOPSIS
       char *patmatch(pattern, aux, string, soff, slen, alt, state)
       char *pattern;
       int *aux;
       char *string;
       int soff;
       int slen;
       int alt;
       int state[];

DESCRIPTION
       patmatch() uses the pattern matching information pattern and in
       addition aux and alt (previously set up by a call to patcompile(3)) to
       check string for a match. The length of the string is slen and the
       starting index used for matching is soff.  The string can also be
       terminated by a null byte.

       The state array is set up and used internally by patmatch and should
       have at least strlen(pattern) + 1 elements.

RETURNS
       Returns a NULL pointer if the string starting at the specified offset
       did not match the pattern.

       Any non-NULL return is a pointer to the first character of string after
       the part that matches.

SEE ALSO
       patcompile(3) for information on aux and alt.

       And match(1) for a description ot the regular expressions.

NOTES
       The pattern matching functions are based on ones presented by Martin
       Richards in "A Compact Function for Regular Expression Pattern
       Matching", Software-Practice and Experience vol 9, 527-534 (1979).
