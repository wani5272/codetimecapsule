NAME
       patcompile() - compiles a matching pattern

SYNOPSIS
       int patcompile(pattern, length, aux)
       char *pattern;
       int length;
       int aux[];

DESCRIPTION
       patcompile() compiles a pattern into an internal form which patmatch(3)
       can use.

       The string at pattern with size length is scanned. The array aux is
       filled in with state information for patmatch(3).  aux should have at
       least length elements.

RETURNS
       Returns 0 if the pattern contains an error.

       Other values should be passed to patmatch(3) as the alt argument.

NOTES
       The pattern matching functions are based on ones presented by Martin
       Richards in "A Compact Function for Regular Expression Pattern
       Matching", Software-Practice and Experience vol 9, 527-534 (1979).
