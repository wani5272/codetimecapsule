RESOLVEPATH(3)		  Schily's LIBRARY FUNCTIONS		RESOLVEPATH(3)

NAME
       resolvepath(), resolvenpath(), resolvefpath() - resolve all symbolic
       links of a path name

SYNOPSIS
       #include <schily/schily.h>

       int
       resolvepath(path, buf, bufsiz)
	       const char    *path;
		     char    *buf;
		     size_t  bufsiz;

       int
       resolvenpath(path, buf, bufsiz)
	       const char    *path;
		     char    *buf;
		     size_t  bufsiz;

       int
       resolvefpath(path, buf, bufsiz, flags)
	       const char    *path;
		     char    *buf;
		     size_t  bufsiz;
		     int     flags;

DESCRIPTION
       resolvepath() takes a relative path name and resolves all smbolic links
       in the path name.  The result is a path name that is free of symbolic
       links.  path is relative path name that is used as the input.  buf is
       the buffer used for the result of the conversion.  bufsiz is the size
       of the result buffer.

       All ``.'' components are eliminated and every non-leading ``..''
       component is eliminated together with its preceding directory
       component. If leading ``..'' components reach to the root directory,
       they are replaced by ``/''.

       resolvenpath() behaves like resolvepath() except that the file does not
       need to exist.

       resolvefpath() takes an additional flags parameter from the set of
       flags from the following set:

       RSPF_EXIST	   All path components must exist.

       RSPF_NOFOLLOW_LAST  Don't follow symbolic links in the last path
			   component.


RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful completion, resolvepath(), resolvenpath() and
       resolvefpath() return the number of bytes placed in the buffer
       Otherwise, -1 is returned and errno is set to indicate the error.  In
       case of an error, the contents of result buffer is left in an
       intermediate state.

ERRORS
       ERANGE	 The path does not fit into the suplied buffer.

       EFAULT	 A null pointer was suplied as pathname.

       EINVAL	 An empty relative path was supplied.

       other	 Any other value that may be a result of an underlying
		 filesystem operation.

USAGE
       Applications should not assume that the returned contents of the buffer
       are null-terminated. This is because the function resolvepath(3) may be
       the Solaris version of the program is compiled on Solaris.
