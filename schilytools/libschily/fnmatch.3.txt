NAME
     fnmatch - match filename or pathname

SYNOPSIS
     #include <fnmatch.h>

     int
     fnmatch(const char *pattern, const char *string, int flags);

DESCRIPTION
     The fnmatch() function matches patterns according to the rules used by
     the shell.	 It checks the string specified by the string argument to see
     if it matches the pattern specified by the pattern argument.

     The flags argument modifies the interpretation of pattern and string.
     The value of flags is the bitwise inclusive OR of any of the following
     constants, which are defined in the include file fnmatch.h.

     FNM_NOESCAPE  Normally, every occurrence of a backslash (`\') followed by
		   a character in pattern is replaced by that character.  This
		   is done to negate any special meaning for the character.
		   If the FNM_NOESCAPE flag is set, a backslash character is
		   treated as an ordinary character.

     FNM_PATHNAME  Slash characters in string must be explicitly matched by
		   slashes in pattern.	If this flag is not set, then slashes
		   are treated as regular characters.

     FNM_PERIOD	   Leading periods in strings match periods in patterns.  The
		   definition of ``leading'' is related to the specification
		   of FNM_PATHNAME. A period is always ``leading'' if it is
		   the first character in string.  Additionally, if
		   FNM_PATHNAME is set, a period is ``leading'' if it
		   immediately follows a slash.

RETURN VALUES
     The fnmatch() function returns zero if string matches the pattern
     specified by pattern, otherwise, it returns the value FNM_NOMATCH.

SEE ALSO
     sh(1), glob(3), regex(3)

STANDARDS
     The fnmatch() function conforms to IEEE Std 1003.2 ("POSIX.2").

HISTORY
     The fnmatch() function first appeared in 4.4BSD.

BUGS
     The pattern `*' matches the empty string, even if FNM_PATHNAME is
     specified.
