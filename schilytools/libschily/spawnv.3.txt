SPAWNV(3)		  Schily's LIBRARY FUNCTIONS		     SPAWNV(3)

NAME
       spawnv() - calls a command with specified arguments

SYNOPSIS
       int spawnv(Sin,Sout,Serr,ArgC,ArgV)
       FILE *Sin, *Sout, *Serr;
       int ArgC;
       char *ArgV[];

DESCRIPTION
       spawnv() causes the command, named in ArgV[0], to be called with the
       given arguments. Functionally this subroutine is the same as spawnl(),
       differing only in the form of the argument.

RETURNS
       Returns 0 when successful. Otherwise, returns a non-zero value which
       could be:

       an error code from fork() or fexecl().  the argument to exit() in the
       Command_name.

       1,     if stopped by a control C (^C).

       2,     if killed by another process.

       4,     if suspended by any fault, raise, control Y ^Y or by another
	      process. (In this case, spawnv() kills the suspended process.)

NOTES
       none
