NAME
       astoi() - converts ASCII to integer

SYNOPSIS
       #include <schily/schily.h>

       char *astoi(string,result)
	    char *string; /* the string to convert */
	    int *result; /* where to store the result */

DESCRIPTION
       astoi() converts the characters pointed to by string to an integer
       stored at result.  It returns a pointer to the first character in the
       string that was not used for the conversion. If the entire string is to
       be used, it should point to a NULL character ('\0').  Leading spaces
       and tabs are skipped.

       The ASCII string accepts a leading `+' or `-'. A leading zero in the
       string makes the number octal, while a leading 0x makes the number
       hexadecimal.  Leading spaces and tabs are skipped.

RETURNS
       Returns a pointer to the first unused character.

EXAMPLES
       if (*astoi(string, &i) != '\0')
	    error("Not a number %s\n", string);

SEE ALSO
       astol(3)

NOTES
       Range errors are not checked. Conversion stops (and a pointer is
       returned) at the first non-numeric character other than the leading
       sign or 0x, as described above.
