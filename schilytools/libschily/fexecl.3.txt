NAME
       fexecl() - executes a program

SYNOPSIS
       fexecl(name, in, out, err, arg0, arg1, ... argn, NULL)
       char *name;
       FILE *in, *out, *err;
       char *arg0...*argn;

DESCRIPTION
       fexecl() is a variation of fexecve(). The description of fexecve()
       applies to fexecl(), with two exceptions.  First, fexecl() does not
       permit the environment list to be specified; it causes the new program
       to have the same environment as the current program, using the global
       environment pointer environ.  Second, the argument list for the new
       program is constructed as part of the call to fexecl(). This is a lot
       easier to write than the code to construct a vector of strings, but is
       limited to cases with a fixed number of arguments. The argument list
       will consist of the strings a0, a1, and so on. By convention, a0 is the
       name of the new program.

RETURNS
       Returns system error code; doesn't return if successful.

NOTES
       none
