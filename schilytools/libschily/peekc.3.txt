PEEKC(3)		  Schily's LIBRARY FUNCTIONS		      PEEKC(3)

NAME
       peekc() - shows the next character in the file

SYNOPSIS
       int peekc(f)
       FILE *f;

DESCRIPTION
       peekc() shows the next character in the file. It does not remove the
       character. The next call to peekc() or getc() will return the same
       character.

RETURNS
       Returns the next character in the file or EOF if the file is at the end
       of data.

NOTES
       This call may be used only on buffered files.

       Notice that peekc() is not declared as type char, since EOF is not a
       valid value for a char object.
