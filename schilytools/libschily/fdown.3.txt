FDOWN(3)		  Schily's LIBRARY FUNCTIONS		      FDOWN(3)

NAME
       fdown() - returns a logical unit number

SYNOPSIS
       int fdown(f)
       FILE *f;

DESCRIPTION
       fdown(), given a standard I/O FILE *f, returns the file number. A file
       number is usually a small number like 2 which is not a unique number
       system-wide but is peculiar to the specified process.  fdown() can be
       used to implement additional functions not provided for in the standard
       I/O library. It verifies that the file was opened via fileopen().

RETURNS
       Returns the actual system file number.

NOTES
       Since this call is system dependent, it should be used carefully.
