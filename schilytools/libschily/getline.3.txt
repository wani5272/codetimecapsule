NAME
       getline() - reads a line from standard input

SYNOPSIS
       int getline(buffer,length)
       char *buffer;
       int length;

DESCRIPTION
       getline() reads up to length characters from the standard input using
       getc() (q.v.). The transfer is also terminated by a newline, end of
       file, or read error. The buffer is NULL ('\0') terminated with the new
       line removed.

RETURNS
       Returns either the number of bytes in the buffer or a standard system
       error code (including EOF).

NOTES
       getline() always reads to the end of the input line, even if the line
       is longer than the buffer.
