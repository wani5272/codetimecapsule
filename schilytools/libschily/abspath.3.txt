ABSPATH(3)		  Schily's LIBRARY FUNCTIONS		    ABSPATH(3)

NAME
       abspath(), absnpath(), absfpath() - Expands a relative pathname to a
       full (absolute) pathname

SYNOPSIS
       #include <schily/schily.h>

       char *
       abspath(relp, absp, asize)
		       const   char    *relp;
			       char    *absp;
			       size_t  asize;

       char *
       absnpath(relp, absp, asize)
		       const   char    *relp;
			       char    *absp;
			       size_t  asize;

       char *
       absfpath(relp, absp, asize, flags)
		       const   char    *relp;
			       char    *absp;
			       size_t  asize;
			       int     flags;

DESCRIPTION
       abspath() takes a relative path name and converts it into an absolute
       path name.  relp is relative path name that is used as the input.  absp
       is the buffer used for the result of the conversion.  asize is the size
       of the result buffer.

       absnpath() behaves like abspath() exept that the file does not need to
       exist.

       absfpath() takes an additional flags parameter from the set of flags
       from resolvefpath() to control the behavior.


RETURN VALUE
       On successful completion, abspath(), absnpath() and absfpath() return a
       pointer to the resolved name absp.  Otherwise, a null pointer is
       returned and errno is set to indicate the error, and the contents of
       the buffer pointed to by absp is left in an indeterminate state.

ERRORS
       ERANGE	 The path does not fit into the suplied buffer.

       EFAULT	 A null pointer was suplied as pathname.

       EINVAL	 An empty relative path was supplied.
