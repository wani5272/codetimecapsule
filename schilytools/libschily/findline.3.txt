NAME
       findline() - finds a line that has a matching field

SYNOPSIS
       int findline(fname,delim,string,field,array,arraysize)
	    char *fname;   /* file name */
	    char delim;	   /* field delimiter */
	    char *string;  /* string to match */
	    int field;	   /* field number to match, 0-n */
	    char *array[]; /* array to fill pointers in */
	    int arraysize; /* number of entries in the arrays */

DESCRIPTION
       findline() retrieves specific fields from the first line of the file
       fname.

       findline() fills in array with pointers to strings that make up the
       fields on the line. The strings are allocated new storage.  The field
       delimiter, delim, is used to break up each line of the file into
       fields. string is the string to match. fieldno is the field number to
       match. Fields are numbered 0..n. array is an array of pointers to fill
       in. arraysize is the number of elements in the array.

RETURNS
       +1     match.

       -1     no match.

       -2     arg error.

       -3     cannot open file.

       -4     not enough memory to allocate space for fields.

NOTES
       Each line of the file must be less than 512 characters long.
