FILE_RAISE(3)		  Schily's LIBRARY FUNCTIONS		 FILE_RAISE(3)

NAME
       file_raise() - controls raising of file_read_err and file_write_err

SYNOPSIS
       file_raise(f,flag)
       FILE *f;
       BOOL flag;

DESCRIPTION
       file_raise() can be used to control whether the conditions
       "file_read_err" and "file_write_err" are raised when an error occurs
       during an I/O function ( fileread(), filewrite() , etc) on FILE f.
       Calling file_raise() with the flag TRUE enables raising, calling it
       with flag FALSE disables raising. If raising is disabled and an error
       occurs the function will return an appropriate error code, this is
       equivalent to handling the condition and ignoring it. The default is to
       raise the conditions.

RETURNS
       none

NOTES
       none
