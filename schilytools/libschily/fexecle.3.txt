FEXECLE(3)		  Schily's LIBRARY FUNCTIONS		    FEXECLE(3)

NAME
       fexecle() - executes a program

SYNOPSIS
       fexecle(name, in, out, err, a0, a1, a2, ... NULL, envptr)
       char *name;
       FILE *in, *out, *err;
       char *a0, *a1, *a2...;
       char **envptr;

DESCRIPTION
       fexecle() is a variation of fexecve().  The description for fexecve()
       also applies to fexecle() except for the argument list. fexecle()
       permits the argument list, which is a vector of pointers with a NULL at
       the end, to be constructed as part of the call to fexecle(), rather
       than as a C vector. Thus, in the new program, av[0] will be the same as
       a0 in this program, etc.

RETURNS
       Returns a system error code; fexecle() does not return if it succeeds.

NOTES
       none
