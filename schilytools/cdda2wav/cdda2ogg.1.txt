DESCRIPTION
       cdda2ogg is a script that uses the cdda2wav command to extract all
       audio tracks with the cdda2wav command and encode them using the
       oggenc(1) Ogg Vorbis encoder.

       cdda2mp3 is a script that uses the cdda2wav command to extract all
       audio tracks with the cdda2wav command and encode them using the
       lame(1) MP3 encoder.

       There is no CDDB support yet.


OPTIONS
       -help	   print a short online usage message and exit.

       dev=device  The device to read the data from. If there is only one CD-
		   ROM drive in the system, the dev= option may be omitted.
		   For possible values of the device parameter, see the
		   cdrecord(1) man page.

       -*	   Any other option beginning with a '-' sign is passed to the
		   cdda2wav program.

       Any other option past the file prefix argument and beginning with a '-'
       sign is passed to the encoder program.

	      To set up default values for cdda2ogg.

       /etc/default/cdda2mp3
