NAME
       label - manipulate Sun disk labels

SYNOPSIS
       label [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       The label command manipulates Sun disk labels. It shares the menu
       subroutines with the sformat(1) command and thus presents the same
       label and partition menu as sformat(1).	The label however does not
       operate by sending SCSI commands to the drive but rather reads and
       writes files.


OPTIONS
       All boolean options can be abbreviated by their first letter.

       -print Print the disk label and the partition table and exit.

       -set   Read the disk label and partition table, set the disk driver
	      geometry and partition tables according to the data read from
	      file and disk and exit.

       lproto= label-name

       if= label-name
	      Set the name of the input file. This may be a plain file or a
	      raw disk device name.

       lname= label-name

       of= label-name
	      Set the name of the output file. This may be a plain file or a
	      raw disk device name.

       f= label-name
	      Set the name for both, the input and the output file. This may
	      be a plain file or a raw disk device name.

       -help  Prints a short summary of the label(1) options and exists.

       -version
	      Prints the label(1) version number string and exists.
