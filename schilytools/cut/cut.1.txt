NAME
       cut - dissects files by field

SYNOPSIS
       cut [ d=C ] [ od=C ] [ c=range ] [ f=range ] [ -nod ] [ -s ] [ file ]

DESCRIPTION
       Cut isolates specified columns or fields of a file, or standard input
       if no file is specified, and reorders them to standard output.

       Cut assumes that the input file is divided into columns of characters
       or fields separated by tabs. You can, however, specify other single
       character delimiters with the d=C option.

       Cut writes its result to standard output with either the default tab or
       the specified delimiter character, specified with the od=C option.

OPTIONS
       d=C    C (a single character) specifies input delimiter (default
	      character is TAB, \t).

       od=C   C (a single character) specifies output delimiter (default
	      character is TAB, \t).

       c=range
	      Specifies the character position to extract. Character positions
	      can be specified individually, by ranges or both, e.g., c=1,2 or
	      c=1-3,5,7-9. Character positions are numbered beginning with 1.

       f=range
	      Specifies field number to extract. Fields can be specified
	      individually or in ranges as with c=range.  Fields are numbered
	      beginning with 1.

       -nod   Suppress output delimiter when cutting by fields.	 Cutting by
	      columns never has an output delimiter.

       -s     Suppresses lines without the delimiter. This option is mutually
	      exclusive to character specification.

NOTES
       none
