NAME
       paste - pastes fields in files together

SYNOPSIS
       paste [ d=list ] [ options ] [ file1 ... filen ]

       spaste [ d=list ] [ options ] [ file1 ... filen ]

DESCRIPTION
       Paste joins separate files by fields. It is the opposite of the program
       cut.

       Paste joins corresponding lines of files creating a single line of text
       with a single character delimiter separating each field.	 The result is
       displayed on standard output.

OPTIONS
       d=list Where list specifies the list of field delimiters used to
	      separate the fields on output.  The fields from the list are
	      used in a cyclic way.  The first element in the list is always
	      used for the delimiter after the first file.  If the list
	      includes a backslash (\), the next character is used with a
	      special meaning:

	      \n     A newline is used as the delimiter.

	      \t     A TAB is used as the delimiter.

	      \\     A backslash is used as the delimiter.

	      \0     No delimiter is inserted.

	      The default delimiter is a single TAB.

       -e     Do not output empty lines.

       -s     Do not paste lines from all files but paste all lines from a
	      single file.  Start with the first entry from the delimiter list
	      with the beginning of a new file.

       width=#,w=#
	      Set the maximum output linewidth (default is to allow an
	      "infinite" output line width).

NOTES
       The maximum number of files that you can join together is 253.
