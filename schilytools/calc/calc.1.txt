NAME
       calc - simple integer calculator that accepts decimal/hex/octal and
       outputs decimal/hex/octal/binary

SYNOPSIS
       calc [ options ]

DESCRIPTION
       The calc command may be used to do simple integer calculations or to
       convert numbers from one radix to another.

       Calc reads commands from stdin and prints the result to stdout.	The
       inpout radix for numbers may be decimal (default), octal (if starting
       with a '0') or hexadecimal (if starting with "0x").  The output is
       always printed in four radixes: decimal, octal, hexadecimal and binary.
       The decimal variant is printed as signed and as unsigned
       representation.

       The result is printed in two variants using 32 bit and 64 bit
       repesentations for the numbers.

INPUT FORMAT
       Calc accepts three types of input lines:

       one number      The input line is onue number only.

		       In this case the number is converted only to the
		       different output formats.

       unary oparator  The input line is a unary oparator followed by a number

		       In this case the unary oparator is applied to the
		       number and the result is printed in all output formats.

       binary oparator The input line is a number followed by a binary
		       oparator followed by a second number.

		       In this case the binari oparator is applied to the
		       numbers and the result is printed in all output
		       formats.

       %	       Binary arithmetic remainder from division.

       /	       Binary arithmetic division.
